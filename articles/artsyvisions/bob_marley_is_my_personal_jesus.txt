Expanding Some of the Ideas
---------------------------
As a teenager in the late 1960s I was confirmed in the Lutheran Church.
My main takeaways from that time were that Jesus was a good role model, and living back then sounds very scary.

As time went on I grew disaffected with organized religion due to the way some preachers twisted it to assuage their own vanity and personal agenda.
Examples range from the sex scandals surrounding Jimmy Swaggart [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Swaggart] to the
horrific massacre perpetrated by Jim Jones in Jonestown [https://www.history.com/news/jonestown-jim-jones-mass-murder-suicide].

This disaffection reached a head with evangelical Christians' support of George W. Bush and his obviously &mdash; to me, anyway &mdash; bogus
wars in the Middle East.
And it grew even deeper with the recent continued obsequiousness of the majority of Evangelicals to the corrupt administration of Donald J. Trump.

There is no better example of this misfeasance in the name of religion than Jerry Falwell Jr.'s recent fall from grace.

My frustration with this hypocritical partisanship, exacerbated by the constant proselytizing of the GOP of a cousin on Facebook,
increased to the point where, at some point in the mid-2000s, I declared myself an atheist.
In my mind I consider these corrupt preachers and those who continue to blindly support Trump's hostility and divisiveness to be Fake Christians.

At this time I am happy to report that my attempt at completely rejecting Christianity has failed miserably.
Just because I reject the Fake Christians' two-faced messaging doesn't mean it make sense to reject the religion entirely.

This year my stance on Christianity has returned to my earlier agnosticism and includes a deep respect for Jesus Christ the man,
regardless of his divinity or possible lack thereof.

This flip-flop of attitudes is due in large part to learning that it is ok for us to have our own personal relationship with Jesus.
Conflation of corrupt preachers and partisan

We do not need formal religion.

Indeed, religious identities are, like all identities, inherently divisive.

We have had enough of that lately!  E.g., Emo Philips' best athiest joke ever.
