<i><u>Bannon, Always the Rebel</u></i> is a biography of Steve Bannon, written by Keith Koffler and published in 2017.  It covers his whole life, from his birth up through his time as Chief Strategist at the White House.

<i><u>Bannon, Always the Rebel</u></i> is one of the nearly twenty books about politicians I read in the summer of 2019 while researching a book about incumbents, candidates, and other politicians.

I am giving the book 3 of 5 stars because, although it is informative and enlightening, it is less comprehensive than the other books I read for this project.  The author verifies this is intentional, writing in the <i><u>Introduction</u></i> that <i>"This, then, is Bannon's story <b>in brief</b>"</i> [p. 3, emphasis added].

One of the most interesting things I learned about Steve from the book is that he and I both grew up in Richmond, Virginia.  In fact, he is just one year older than me, so both of us, and our families, lived there at the same time.  However, while I went to public school at Huguenot, he went to Catholic School at Benedictine.  I quickly recognized the name of the military academy because some of my friends in the neighborhood also went to school there - so that was an unexpected connection.

The most important thing I learned from <i><u>Bannon, Always the Rebel</u></i> is that Steve Bannon is well-read - and especially fond of history.  Examples of his favorite books are <i><u>The Imitation of Christ</u></i> by Thomas Kempis and <i><u>The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</u></i> by Edward Gibbon.

Concerned that America is on track to suffer a fate similar to that of the once great Roman empire, Steve is alarmed by some of the changes currently taking place in American culture.  This concern is at the root of his nationalistic populism, and it is why he has aligned himself with the Tea Party and worked with politicians like Sarah Palin and Donald Trump.
<blockquote><i>Bannon believed that if America was going to retrieve its traditional culture, then the Tea Party <b>had</b> to succeed, because the Tea Party, in fact, <b>was</b> that culture, the dominant American culture of 1776 through the 1950s.  "It's the voice of the working man and woman in this country," Bannon said during a February 2010 appearance on Sean Hannity's Fox News show.  "It's the decent people who fight our wars, who run our civic organizations, who are the backbone of this country."</i>

In his book <i><u>Fire and Fury, Inside the Trump White House</u></i> author Michael Wolff states <i>"The paradox of the Trump presidency was that it was both the most ideologically driven and the least"</i> [p. 177].  It is widely acknowledged that Donald Trump has little or no ideology.  <i><u>Bannon, Always the Rebel</u></i> makes it obvious that Steve provided what Donald lacks in this regard.

After reading Keith Koffler's book about Steve Bannon, I created a profile for Steve and included his spiritual portrait in my ebook <i><u><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Visualizing-Politicians-Personalities-Incumbents-Candidates-ebook/dp/B07XYHQ16R/">Visualizing Politicians' Personalities, 2019 Incumbents and Candidates.</a></u></i>  I based the abstract image of Steve's personality in the ebook on this book, so it of course contains more about <i><u>Bannon, Always the Rebel</u></i> - in case you are interested.
