<i><u>Fire and Fury</u></i> and <i><u>Siege</u></i> are books by Michael Wolff published in 2018 and ___.

Both books about the presidency of Donald Trump.


<i><u>Fire and Fury</u></i> is one of the nearly twenty books about politicians I read in the summer of 2019 while researching a book about incumbents, candidates, and other politicians.


I am giving the pair of books 4 of 5 stars because at this time goodreads does not list them individually.
If I could rate them separately, I would give <i><u>Fire and Fury</u></i> 5 of 5 stars and <i><u>Siege</u></i> 3 of 5 stars, because I liked Michael Wolff's first book a lot but found his second book to be mostly just more of the same.



Not very objective - does not make Trump or anyone around him look very good.


[Key takeaway - most remarkable/incredible/awesome/surprising/interesting/fascinating thing I learned about them from this book is ___.]

After reading Michael Wolff's book about [Topic] I incorporated the insight gained to help describe one or more of the spiritual portraits in my ebook <i><u><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Visualizing-Politicians-Personalities-Incumbents-Candidates-ebook/dp/B07XYHQ16R/">Visualizing Politicians' Personalities, 2019 Incumbents and Candidates.</a></u></i>

I based the abstract image of [person]'s personality in the ebook on this book, so it of course contains more about <i><u>Fire and Fury</u></i> - in case you are interested.
