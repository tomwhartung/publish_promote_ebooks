Checking on some common aspect ratios for mobile devices

# Rationale

Writing books for mobile devices:

- It is sometimes essential for some text to be part of the image
- I don't know whether the person is reading in landscape or portrait mode
- My images are square
- For each image, especially in the early chapters, I want to use:
  - Square image with text on the right
    - Maxes out my square image in landscape mode
  - Descriptive text about the image
  - Square image with text underneath it
    - Maxes out my square image in portrait mode

# Results

**Target 16:9 or 8:5, which is the same as 16:10 .**

- 16:9 - hdtv is popular now (1-top 2 for US) (3) (4)
- 8:5 - also popular (2) (3)
- 5:3 - popular on android (3)
- 4:3 - old TVs (4)
