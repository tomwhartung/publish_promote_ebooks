# Use High Resolution Images

- 300 dpi
- 1800 px wide - for full width of page
  - "Page" may be portrait or landscape

# Resolution + Aspect Ratio

## Most Popular: 16 x 9 and 16 x 10

Pick one aspect ratio, 16 x 9 or 16 x 10, for Landscape images, and use the other portrait images.

- Landscape 16 x 10: 2880 x 1800
  - 8 x 5 ~= 16 x 10 ~= 2880 x 1800
- Landscape 16 x 9: 3200 x 1800
  - 16 x 9 ~= 3200 x 1800
  - Allows more room for text

- Portrait 16 x 10: 1800 x 2880
  - 8 x 5 ~= 16 x 10 ~= 2880 x 1800
- Portrait 16 x 9: 1800 x 3200
