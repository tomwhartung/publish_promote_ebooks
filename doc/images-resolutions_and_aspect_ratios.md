Resolutions to use for posting images to social networking sites.

Starting points for sizes come from what we used for ebooks.

# Use Medium Resolution Images

- 100 dpi
- 1800 px wide - for full width of page
- **Regardless of orientation, 1800 px is the resolution side of the shortest side**

# Resolution + Aspect Ratio

Use these aspect ratios as a starting point.

Add space to image as necessary to fit everything on it ok.

## Square Images

- 1800 px x 1800 px

## Most Popular: 16 x 9 and 16 x 10

- Landscape 16 x 10: 2880 x 1800
  - 8 x 5 ~= 16 x 10 ~= 2880 x 1800
- Landscape 16 x 9: 3200 x 1800
  - 16 x 9 ~= 3200 x 1800
  - Allows more room for text
