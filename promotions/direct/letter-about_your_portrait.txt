Dear ___,

My name is Tom Hartung and - please don't laugh, I'm serious - I draw personalities.

The images are abstract - because personalities are abstract - and I use a computer program I wrote years ago to generate them.

The content for the images comes from the answers to a questionnaire based on Jungian Archetypes, so the basis for my work is the same as that for the well-known Meyers Briggs Type Indicator or MBTI.

For reasons you can read here [link to medium article about Mondrian's Optimism], I have produced an image - a spiritual portrait - of your personality, and included it in my new book [link to book on amazon].

A copy of your image appears below.

I understand that not everyone will appreciate these images.  To be honest, it took me a while to appreciate them.  One thing I have noticed, though, is once someone is exposed to this idea and the images, they stick with you.

Due to time constraints, I have taken it upon myself to complete your profile.  It would be GREAT if you would answer the questionnaire yourself, so I can get the REAL THING instead of my educated guesses.

If you are interested in answering a questionnaire, please respond and I will send you details about the proces.

If you're not interested, no worries.  I am just

If you want to think about it and get back to me later, that is fine too.

Thanks for taking time to read this and give my idea some consideration - and for being willing to suffer the slings and arrows it has become necessary to endure in order to serve the people in today's raucous political climate.

Tom W. Hartung
