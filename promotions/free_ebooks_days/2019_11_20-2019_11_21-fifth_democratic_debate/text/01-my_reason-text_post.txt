Over the summer of 2019 I read 19 books about politicians and politics, then wrote my own ebook, Visualizing Politicians' Personalities.
I did not do this for the money!
In fact, you can get a copy of all of my ebooks FOR FREE this Wednesday 11/20 and Thursday 11/21 on amazon!
I write these ebooks because I am literally teaching myself to see beneath the surface of people, and I want to share this vision.
If you want to know more about my motivation for writing Visualizing Politicians' Personalities in particular, however, check out this article, which contains an excerpt from the ebook:

Here is a quote from the article:
"Mondrian’s vision, as manifested in his abstract paintings, convinced him that the natural conflict between opposites did not have to be violent and destructive, but could be — and in fact was destined to be — peaceful and constructive."
Thanks!
