Over the summer of 2019 I read 19 books about politicians and politics, then I wrote my own ebook.
I did not do this for the money!
In fact, you can get a copy of my book FOR FREE this Wednesday 11/20 and Thursday 11/21.
I wrote this ebook because I am teaching myself to see beneath the surface of people, and I want to share this vision.
If you want to know more about my motivation, check out this article, which contains an excerpt from my ebook:

And, to pique your interest, here is a quote from the article:
"Mondrian’s vision, as manifested in his abstract paintings, convinced him that the natural conflict between opposites did not have to be violent and destructive, but could be — and in fact was destined to be — peaceful and constructive."
Thanks!
