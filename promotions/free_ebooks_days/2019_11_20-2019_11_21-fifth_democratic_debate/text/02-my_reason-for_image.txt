In 2019 I read 19 books about politicians and politics, then wrote my own ebook, Visualizing Politicians' Personalities.
You can get a copy of all my new ebooks FOR FREE this Wednesday 11/20 and Thursday 11/21 on amazon.com!
To understand why I wrote Visualizing Politicians' Personalities, check out this article, entitled Piet Mondrian's Optimism:

The article contains an excerpt from the ebook, and here is a quote from it:
"Mondrian’s vision, as manifested in his abstract paintings, convinced him that the natural conflict between opposites did not have to be violent and destructive, but could be — and in fact was destined to be — peaceful and constructive."
Thanks!
