How I Draw Personalities

Step 1 - Learn about the person

When I wrote the first Groja (c) Program back in the 1980s, I
would invite friends over to try to answer the questionnaire the
way we thought a someone famous or a character on TV would.

During one of those parties some friends
and I created the profile for this image of
Thomas Jefferson's personality.  I grew up
in Virginia and always thought very highly
of him.  He made me proud to be named
Tom!

The more I know about a person, the easier
it is to answer the questionnaire, so lately I
have been reading more biographies.  Recently
I read about a third of American Sphinx: The Character of Thomas
Jefferson by Joseph Ellis, which is quite deep.  Reading Joseph's
book reinforced my confidence in the accuracy of this image.

This step trivial for people who are willing to answer
the questionnaire!
