Carl Jung's archetypes inspired Katherine Cook Briggs and her daughter Isabel Briggs Myers to create the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator or MBTI(r).  My preferred questionnaire is the Keirsey Temperament Sorter, which appears in the book Please Understand Me by David Keirsey and Marilyn Bates.  Not to be outdone, I provide the SeeOurMinds Quiz on my site SeeOurMinds.com.  It is a questionnaire I wrote and comes in a wide variety of sizes.
