I use the Groja(c) program to draw the image.  GRoJA stands for Graphical Representations of Jungian Archetypes.
This program is no longer online due to lack of interest, but I still run it locally to create new images.

I wrote the first version of this program in LISP on an 8088 PC in the late 1980s.
