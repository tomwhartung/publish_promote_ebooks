Fictional FBI Special Agents Fox Mulder [INFP] and Dana Scully [ESTJ] are psychological opposites, so there was some friction when they first met.  However, because they have a shared goal, they adapt, learn to work well together, and even come to lean on one another.
Ultimately Mulder and Scully make a small yet psychologically diverse team.
