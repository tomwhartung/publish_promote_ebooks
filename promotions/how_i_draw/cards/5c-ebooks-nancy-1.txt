This image of Nancy Pelosi's personality is from Visualizing Politicians' Personalities, 2019 Incumbents and Candidates.
The book features spiritual portraits of four incumbents and nine candidates, including Amy, Bernie, Elizabeth, Joe, and Pete.

I read over a dozen biographies when researching this book and did my best to make it objective and bias-free.
