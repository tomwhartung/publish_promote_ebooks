Sam [ESTP] and Diane [ENFP] have opposing personalities, but they
are also open enough to give romance a chance.  Hilarity ensues!

Their differences fuel an intense attraction, but a side effect is
they have little common ground on which to build a relationship.

In an abstract sense, their relationship is similar that of President
Franklin Roosevelt and his wife Eleanor.  Sam lacks Franklin's
ambition, but he has Carla to run the bar while he has his fun.
