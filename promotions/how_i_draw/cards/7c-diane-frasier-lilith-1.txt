On the rebound from Sam, Diane [ENFP] finds solace in Frasier
Crane, who has a spirit more similar to hers [also ENFP].

Diane has difficulty making decisions, and the ones she manages
to make tend to be irrational.  She breaks Frasier's heart, and he
trades the warm Diane and her extreme indecisiveness for the
freezing cold Lilith Sternin [INTJ] and her extreme rationality.

After a rocky start, Frasier and Lilith learn to love one another and
form a family.

Lilith may lack warmth, but she is consistent and does not play
games.  Importantly, Frasier finds the warmth and camaraderie
he needs in Sam, Norm, Cliff and the rest of the gang at Cheers.
