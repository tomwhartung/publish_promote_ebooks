In addition to having extreme personalities, Norm Peterson [ESFP]
and Lilith [INTJ] are total opposites.  Where Norm is open and loves
everyone, Lilith is closed off and has little patience for others.

Norm and Lilith could form an incredible team, but it's difficult
to imagine a goal they could possibly agree on pursuing together!

People with extreme personalities are rare.  The strong preferences
mask corresponding weaknesses, so they need trustworthy friends.
These images show the range of personalities my process can depict.
