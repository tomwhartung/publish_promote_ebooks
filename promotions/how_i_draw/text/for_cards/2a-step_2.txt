How I Draw Personalities

1. Learn about the person
2. Answer a questionnaire
- Images express Jungian Archetypes
- Images are based *solely* on the results
3. Use a program to draw the image
4. Post images online
5. Use selected images in ebooks
6. Post images to social networks

Next up: more about Step 2, with self-portraits of me!
