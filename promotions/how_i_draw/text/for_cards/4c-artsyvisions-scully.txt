How I Draw Personalities

Step 4 - Post images online

For the most part, the galleries at SeeOurMinds.com present each
image individually.  Also, over the years the quality of the stories
about these images has become very inconsistent.

More and more, I enjoy learning about the
people and creating the images more than
writing about them.  And at this point, if I
am going to bother writing about them -
which is super-important - I want to pick
my subjects carefully, take my time about
it, and write something really good.

This thinking led to creating my newest
site, ArtsyVisions.com, in 2018.  It is kind
of like the Greatest Hits version of SeeOurMinds.com, and
features only the most interesting images and the best articles.

In addition to articles about individuals, ArtsyVisions.com also
hosts stories about couples and other pairs and small groups of
people.  After writing several stories about small groups for the
site, I decided to start writing about larger groups in ebooks.
