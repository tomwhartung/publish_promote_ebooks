How I Draw Personalities

Step 6 - Post images to social networks

Hopefully sharing this background information has been
interesting and enlightening.  I cannot afford to advertise, so if

This image of Patrick Henry's personality
shows he was much warmer than the other
Founders featured in this series.  Patrick
was a major player in Virginia, but he
refused George Washington's requests to
play a role in the federal government.

The last combo image in this series shows
these spiritual portraits make it easy to see
how psychologically diverse a team is, and
where and how differences can cause conflict.  I wonder whether
George had any idea of what he was getting into when he
brought Jefferson in to join Hamilton as a member of his cabinet!
