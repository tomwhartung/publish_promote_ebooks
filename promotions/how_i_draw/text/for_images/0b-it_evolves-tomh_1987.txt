How I Draw Personalities

Certainly the idea of drawing a personality is new to many people.
Although I have been doing this since the 1980s, I am a quiet
person, and moreover, quite well aware that many people are not
comfortable with abstractions.

Personalities are abstract, so images of
personalities must also be abstract.  The
ability to understand abstractions is a key
difference between people and machines.

This is the second in a series of about two
dozen posts describing how I draw
personalities.  Most importantly, the
process is constantlyevolving - and I'm
already working on updates to the process.

This self-portrait is one of the first images
I created.  What it says about me - even
now, over thirty years later - is that I'm an independent thinker,
an INFP to be precise.  I could not care less about what others
think of these images, because creating them is my passion.  Of
course, if I can make a buck off of this idea, that would be sweet!

The fact that I am always learning is reason enough for me to
draw personalities.  If you enjoy it too, cool!  Please buy a book!!
