How I Draw Personalities

Step 1 - Research the Person

Videos are available for some people, both fictional and non-fictional, and a focused 90-minute movie can in some cases be just enough to create a profile.

In some cases -- but not all -- a movie is enough.

Trilogies of movies can allow creating profiles for multiple protagonists in the series, and multple seasons of shows with ensemble casts can provide a universe of characters worthy of portrayal.

The more I know about a person, the easier it is to answer the questionnaire - and I now prefer reading a biography to watching a video.

This step trivial for people who are willing to answer the questionnaire.
