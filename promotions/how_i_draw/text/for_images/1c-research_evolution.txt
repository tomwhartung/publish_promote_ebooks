How I Draw Personalities

Step 1 - Research the Person - Example

When I wrote the first Groja (c) Program, back in grad school at VCU in the 1980s, I would invite friends over to try to answer the questionnaire the way we thought a someone famous or a character on TV would.

More recently, in 2018 I read Ron Chernow's excellent 738-page biography of Alexander Hamilton.

Reading Chernow's biography gave me a lot of confidence when answering the questionnaire for Alexander, so I started doing more of that.
