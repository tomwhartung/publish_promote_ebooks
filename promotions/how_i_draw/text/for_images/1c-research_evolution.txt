How I Draw Personalities

Step 1 - Learn about the person

Videos are available for some people, both fictional and real, and
a focused 90-minute movie can in some cases be just enough to
create a profile.

In some cases -- but not all -- a movie has
enough character development to allow
completing the questionnaire.  For example,
I have drawn images based on Citizen Kane
and China Town, but they were difficult.

Trilogies of movies can allow creating
profiles for multiple characters in the series,
and multple seasons of shows with ensemble
casts, such as Game of Thrones and The Wire, can provide a
universe of personalities worth drawing -- and comparing.

In 2018 I read Ron Chernow's 738-page biography of Alexander
Hamilton.  Chernow's biography inspired Lin-Manuel Miranda to
write the musical and gave me a lot of confidence when answering
the questionnaire for Hamilton, so I now read more biographies.
