How I Draw Personalities

Step 2 - Answer a questionnaire

I base all of the images I draw on Carl Jung's Archetypes.

In his treatise General Description of the Types, Jung describes the
mental functions he calls extraversion and introversion, intuition
and sensing, feeling and thinking, and judging
and perceiving.  These are very abstract
terms, making them well-suited to portrayal
in abstract art.

All Jungian typology questionnaires have
similar questions, such as whether you
chat up strangers when waiting in line, or
do you tend to use your head or your heart
to make decisions.  There are no right or
wrong answers, but answering the questions can be quite difficult
nonetheless.

The self-portrait on this page reflects the results of my taking the
Jung Typology Test at HumanMetrics.com in 2008.

Most of the images I create are based on the Keirsey
Temperament Sorter, found in the book Please Understand Me.
