How I Draw Personalities

Step 2 - Answer a Questionnaire - MBTI(r) Example

The work by Katherine Cook Briggs and her daughter Isabel Briggs Myers on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator or MBTI(r) was one of many inspirations for this project.

The questionnaires I use for these images are based on Carl Jung's personality archetypes, so - like the MBTI - the questionnaires' results can be expressed in four-letter types such as ENFJ and ISTP.

In the mid-1990s I took the MBTI, and this is an image of the results:
