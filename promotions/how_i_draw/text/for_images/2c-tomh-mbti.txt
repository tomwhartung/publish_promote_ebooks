How I Draw Personalities

Step 2 - Answer a questionnaire

The work by Katherine Cook Briggs and her daughter Isabel Briggs
Myers on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator or MBTI(r) was one of
many inspirations for this project.  Unfortunately, it costs money
to take the MBTI, making it unsuitable for generating the hundreds
of profiles I have created over the years.

The self-portrait on this page reflects the
results of the MBTI, which I first took in
the 1990s then re-took recently.

In their book Please Understand Me, first
published in 1978, David Keirsey and
Marilyn Bates generously include a question-
naire they call the Keirsey Temperament
Sorter.  A slightly different version appears in
their follow-up work Please Understand Me II, published in 1998.

I cannot post Keirsey's Temperament Sorter online, so I have
written the SeeOurMinds Quiz for people to use if they so desire.
It has a total of 88 questions, and I require answers to at least 44
of them before I can draw a person's spiritual portrait.
