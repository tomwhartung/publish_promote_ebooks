How I Draw Personalities

Step 2 - Answer a Questionnaire - How I Made It My Own

Some of the questions on a typical Jungian Typology questionnaire can be very difficult, regardless of one's knowledge of the subject.

Who can say for sure whether a historical character might prefer metaphor to facts, or whether a fictional or historical character would prefer justice to mercy?  Sometimes it's easy, sometimes it's a nightmare.

At some point I found a questionnaire online that is suspiciously similar, but not quite identical, to the ones in David Keirsey's Please Understand Me books, and printed it out.

Over the years I have made many notes on the hard copy of this questionnaire, and with repeated use even the most puzzling questions have taken on their own character in my mind.

It may have started out as being "suspiciously similar" to one of David Keirsey's questionnaires, but over the years I have made this particular questionnaire my own.



Having tried a variety of questionnaires and drawn hundreds of profiles, I have found the questionnaires in David Keirsey's Please Understand Me books to be my favorites.


The SeeOurMinds Quiz has several options, ranging from 2XS (12 questions) to 2XL (88 questions).  Medium (44 questions) is the minimum I need to draw an image.


Answering more questions increases the image's accuracy and uniqueness.

Keirsey's Temperament Sorters have 70 questions, and a good Goldilocks option between too many and too few.


The questionnaires I use for these images are based on Carl Jung's personality archetypes, so - like the MBTI - the questionnaires' results can be expressed in four-letter types such as ENFJ and ISTP.
