How I Draw Personalities

Step 3 - Use a program to draw the image

Once I have the results of a Jungian archetypes questionnaire, I
use the Groja(c) program to draw the image.  GRoJA stands for
Graphical Representations of Jungian Archetypes.

The Groja program translates the results
into an image containing Blue, Green,
Red, and Yellow squares.  One of these
four colors dominates each image, and
another plays a supporting role.

In Jungian terms, the amount of Blue in
a spiritual portrait reflects a person's
preference for iNtuition, and Yellow
represents their preference for Sensation,
both of which are Perceiving functions and imply openness.
Similarly, the amount of Green in the image reflects their
preference for Thinking, and Red represents a preference for
Feeling, both of which are Judging functions and imply
determination.  Images of Extroverts contain a Vertical line and
Introverts' portraits contain a Horizontal line - but these can be
difficult to see when preferences are strong.
