How I Draw Personalities

Step 3 - Draw the Image

The Groja(c) program draws the image by translating the results -- preferably in percentages -- of a Jungian questionnaire into an image.  The resultant image expresses the answers into a multitude of squares drawn in one of the four primary colors Blue, Green, Red, or Yellow.

GRoJA is an acronym for Graphical Representations of Jungian Archetypes.

In Jungian terms, Blue represents iNtuition - a Perceiving function; Yellow represents Sensation - also a Perceiving function; Green represents Thinking - a Judging function; and Red represents Feeling - also a Judging function.  Images of Extroverts contain a Vertical line and images of Introverts contain a Horizontal line.
