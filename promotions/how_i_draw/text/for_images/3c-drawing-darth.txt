How I Draw Personalities

Step 3 - Use a program to draw the image

Drawing the image is the easiest and most fun step in the process.
There are random elements to the images, so I generate several
versions for each personality and pick the one I like the best.

I wrote the first version of the Groja(c)
program on a PC in LISP while in graduate
school at Virginia Commonwealth
University in the late 1980s.

As technology has evolved, I have written
a few versions of the Groja program in
PHP, using CMSes such as Joomla, and
put them online.

Monetization of a project like this can be
challenging, and I found it makes more sense for me to just run
the site locally when I need to, rather than attract hackers, who
as it turns out just love those PHP CMSes.
