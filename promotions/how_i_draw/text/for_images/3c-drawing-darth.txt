How I Draw Personalities

Step 3 - Draw the Image - Example

As technology has evolved, I have written several versions of the Groja(c) program and put them online.  The most recent version is based on Joomla.

Once the site was online, it quickly became apparent only spammers were interested in it, hoping to find a technical vulnerability so they could post their spammy links.  So I now keep the joomla version private and have a much more secure python site for public use.

Sometimes it seems I am the only person interested in visualizing personalities - and that is fine with me!  Here is one of my favorite images, of the personality of Thomas Jefferson:
