How I Draw Personalities

Step 4 - Post images online

Over the years I have created a few web sites to showcase
these images.  The sites are Groja.com, SeeOurMinds.com, and
ArtsyVisions.com, and I have switched from PHP to Python.

Groja.com features an About page with an
overview of what spiritual portraits are all
about.  It is also where you can go to join
my email list.

SeeOurMinds.com features galleries and
the SeeOurMinds Quiz.

The galleries at SeeOurMinds.com contain
just about every image I have ever
created.  This includes images of hundreds
of personalities - both real and fictional.  You can find images of
androids' personalities under Star Wars, images of my kitty cats'
personalities under Family, and even some I consider to be
mistakes under Experiments.

The SeeOurMinds Quiz has several options, ranging from 2XS or
12 questions to 2XL or 88 questions.
