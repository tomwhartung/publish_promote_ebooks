How I Draw Personalities

Step 4 - Post to Sites

Groja.com contains an overview of what spiritual portraits are all about and enables you to sign up for my email list.

The galleries at SeeOurMinds.com host the images of hundreds of personalities - both real and fictional.

SeeOurMinds.com also host the SeeOurMinds Quiz, which you can use to discover your preferences and ultimately see your portrait.

Created in 2018, ArtsyVisions.com is the newest site.  It hosts some favorite portraits of individuals, pairs, and small groups of people who are related in some way.  Writing stores about these pairs and groups of images is what made me decide to start writing ebooks.

Work on these sites is on hold for the time being while I write ebooks.
