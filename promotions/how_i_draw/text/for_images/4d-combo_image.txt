Fictional FBI Special Agents Fox Mulder [INFP] and Dana Scully [ESTJ] are psychological opposites.
Because Mulder and Scully have a shared goal, they can work together and make a small yet psychologically diverse team.
This also helps make the X-Files much more interesting than most other TV shows at that time.
