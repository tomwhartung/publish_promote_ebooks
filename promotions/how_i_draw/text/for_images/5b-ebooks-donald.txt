How I Draw Personalities

Step 5 - Use selected images in ebooks

Creating single spiritual portraits is just the beginning.  Seeing
patterns of similarities and differences in the images, and looking
at the portraits in different contexts can be fun and enlightening,
leading to "ah-hah" moments - which are always fun!

Drawing personalities is an idea well-suited
to books because they allow presention of
a specific universe of personalities in a
logical, step-by-step fashion. Ideally, people
who know all of the players in a given
universe, such as contemporary politicians
or America's Founders, will be able to
understand the images without needing
to understand the underlying psychology.

This image of Donald Trump's personality is from my most recent
ebook, Visualizing Politicians' Personalities, 2019 Incumbents and
Candidates.  It includes people from both parties and is only $5.95!

This and my other ebooks are available exclusively on Amazon.
