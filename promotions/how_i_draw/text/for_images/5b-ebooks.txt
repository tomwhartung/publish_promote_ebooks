How I Draw Personalities

Step 5 - Ebooks

This idea is well-suited to books and ebooks, because those formats allow presenting the images in a logical, step-by-step fashion, and in different contexts.

My first ebook is Visualizing Game of Thrones Personalities.  Note there are two editions of it, one big and one small.  I recommend the Full Edition.

My newest ebook is Visualizing Politicians' Personalities, 2019 Incumbents and Candidates.

I am currently working on my next ebook, Visualizing Teams on the Wire, and hope to have it available for purchase very soon!

All ebooks are available exclusively on Amazon.com, where the URL of my author page is http://Amazon.com/Author/TomWHartung
