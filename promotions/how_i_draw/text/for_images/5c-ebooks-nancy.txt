How I Draw Personalities

Step 5 - Use selected images in ebooks

The first ebook I wrote is Visualizing Game of Thrones Personalities,
which comes in two editions of it.  I recommend the Full Edition
because it contains everything in the Mini-Ebook edition plus a
whole lot more.

This image of Nancy Pelosi's personality
is from my newest ebook, Visualizing
Politicians' Personalities, 2019 Incumbents
and Candidates.  It features four incumbents
and nine candidates, including Amy, Bernie,
Elizabeth, Joe, and Pete.  I read over a
dozen biographies for this project and do
my best to make it objective and bias-free,
but of course nobody's perfect!

Currently I am finishing up work on my next ebook, Visualizing
Teams on the Wire.  I hope to have it finished, or at least available
for presale, by summer.

Ultimately the quality of the images in ebooks is limited.  Bigger
images are much more powerful and expressive than smaller ones,
so I hope to eventually create a traditional print book.
