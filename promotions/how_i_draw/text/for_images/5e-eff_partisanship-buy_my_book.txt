If Donald and Nancy shared a common goal -- and ostensibly they do -- Donald and Nancy could make a powerful team.

Unfortunately, in today's extremely hostile partisan climate, their teamwork is not producing much more than a reality show.

You have to admit, no matter which side, it is a pretty engrossing program!

Make no mistake, everyone is to blame here.  I for one would like to help, but I feel ignored.  Everyone is captivated by the reality show.

Poor me!  Please buy my book!

If people don't buy this one, I probably won't write any more of theese political books.
