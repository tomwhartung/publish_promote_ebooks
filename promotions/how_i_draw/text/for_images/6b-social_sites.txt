How I Draw Personalities

Step 6 - Social Sites

I am just starting to share these images on social networking now - seriously, like just this year!

At first I was going to just post some images and hope that, as people saw more and more of them, they would start see the same patterns I see.

Of course, just because these patterns may obvious to me, doesn't mean they are obvious to everyone.

So after some consideration I decided to start out by posting some introductory material such as this how-I-draw-personalities series.

Hopefully sharing this background information has been interesting, informative, and helpful!
