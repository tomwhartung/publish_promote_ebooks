How I Draw Personalities

Step 6 - Post images to social networks

I am just starting to share these images on social networking sites
now - seriously, like just this past year!

At first I thought about just posting some images and hoping that,
as people saw more and more of them, they
would start see the same patterns I see.  Of
course, just because these patterns are
obvious to me, doesn't mean they are
obvious to everyone.

So after thinking it over a bit, I decided
to start out by posting some introductory
material such as this how-I-draw-person-
alities series.

Also, if I had my druthers, I'd be drawing the personalities of
ground-breaking artists like Isadora Duncan, Miles Davis, and
John Lydon.  Again, after some thought, it hit me people might
be more interested in seeing the personalities of the people on
our money - famous people who many actually might know.

Making money is not my primary goal, but it would be nice!
