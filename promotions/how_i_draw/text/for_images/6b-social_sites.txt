How I Draw Personalities

Step 6 - Post images to social networks

I am just starting to share these images on social networking sites
now - seriously, like just this past year!

At first I thought about just posting some images and hoping that,
as people saw more and more of them, they
would start see the same patterns I see.  Of
course, just because these patterns are
obvious to me, doesn't mean they are
obvious to everyone.

So after thinking it over a bit, I decided
to start out by posting some introductory
material such as this how-I-draw-person-
alities series.

Hopefully sharing this background information has been
interesting and enlightening.  If so, please Like and Share!
