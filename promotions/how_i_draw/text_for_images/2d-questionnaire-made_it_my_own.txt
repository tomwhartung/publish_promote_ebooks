How I Draw Personalities

Step 2 - Answer a Questionnaire - How I Made It My Own

Some of the questions on a typical Jungian Typology questionnaire can be very difficult, regardless of one's knowledge of the subject.

Who can say for sure whether a historical character might prefer metaphor to facts, or whether a fictional character might chat up a stranger while standing in line?

At some point I found a questionnaire online that is suspiciously similar, but not quite identical, to the ones in David Keirsey's Please Understand Me books, and printed it out.

Over the years I have made many notes on the hard copy of this questionnaire, and with repeated use even the most puzzling questions have taken on their own character in my mind.

It may have started out as being "suspiciously similar" to one of David Keirsey's questionnaires, but over the years I have made this particular questionnaire my own.
