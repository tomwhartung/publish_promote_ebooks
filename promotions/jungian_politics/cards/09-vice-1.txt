The political situation has gotten so ridiculous lately I find myself apologizing on Fb for Ha-ha-ing otherwise serious posts.  The movie Vice, which is about Dick Cheney, makes no apologies for its Ha-ha-ing some of what the former Vice President did because, well, it's a movie.
It does not portray Dick very favorably, but does show a bit of his background, so at least you know where he's coming from - which is Wyoming, btw.  There is definitely some silliness, which some may find offensive given the seriousness of some of the things he did.  I for one did not find the silliness offensive, but do have an issue with the casting of so many familiar faces - Christian Bale excepted, because his makeup and acting are incredible - because I found myself wondering where I saw so-and-so, which took me out of the movie.  This is, of course, why Game of Thrones cast so many fresh faces, but that is, of course, getting off course.
I found Vice at the Denver Public Library, which means that you could find it there too, and take your time in watching it, presumably totally for free - but I suppose ultimately at the expense of us taxpayers.  See, socialism ain't all that bad after all.
