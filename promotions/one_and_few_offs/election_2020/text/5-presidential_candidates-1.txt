Happy Republican Convention Week!  These images are based on Jungian Archetypes and I created them to help see past the surface of the candidates.  This week I will explain the first two images of Donald and Mike.  See last week's posts to learn about the other two.  Hopefully we will all make it through all this, all in one piece!
