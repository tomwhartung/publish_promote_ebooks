Based on my Big Five/OCEAN analysis, Donald is pathologically disagreeable.  This disagreeableness is infectious, and his divisiveness now has Americans killing one another in the streets.  He does not care about conservatives, liberals, or anyone else but himself.  If you want more American Carnage, by all means vote for Trump/Pence.
