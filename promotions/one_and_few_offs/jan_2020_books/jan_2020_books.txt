In January of 2020 I read Minority Leader by Stacey Abrams and Triggered by Donald Trump Jr.  Both were a little outside my comfort level, but I enjoyed them quite a bit!
It's good to know the two share at least one opinion on a very important matter.  All that is a bit of a story, so to learn what that is, you will have to read one or both of my reviews on goodreads.
