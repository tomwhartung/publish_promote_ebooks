Vladimir has been an inspiration to me lately, because I have been without hot water for over a week!
Leaks in my sewer line were misdiagnosed as less serious drainage leaks just before the lockdown, so I unwittingly waited to have the work done.
Now the pilot will not stay lit, and I am stuck living with cold showers, but at least I got a correct assessment of the issue.
It's always relative, and there are always two sides.
