Vladimir has been an inspiration to me lately, because I have been without hot water for about two weeks now!  Leaks in my sewer line were misdiagnosed as less serious drainage leaks just before the lockdown, so I unwittingly waited to have the work done.  Now I am stuck living with cold showers, but at least I know what's wrong.  It's going to cost me about $10,000 to get my hot water back!
