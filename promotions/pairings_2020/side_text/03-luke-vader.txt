Luke Skywalker - ENTP
---------------------
[BG] Dominated by Blue and Green, his image shows he is idealistic and logical -- and a bit like Thomas Jefferson [INTP]
[B] When his adoptive parents are killed in cold blood, he learns how to use The Force and his mind to control matter
[G] Luke has a slight tendency to be cold and logical, but his emotions are mostly positive, so he can resist the Dark Side

Darth Vader - ISTJ
------------------
[GR] Dominated by Green and Red, his image shows he is very stubborn -- a bit like Alexander Hamilton [ESTJ]
[Y] As a Padawan apprentice, he sees his Jedi training as being more of a chore than a path to enlightenment
[G] Vader has a slight tendency to be logical and cold-hearted, but he is also angry and embraces the Dark Side
