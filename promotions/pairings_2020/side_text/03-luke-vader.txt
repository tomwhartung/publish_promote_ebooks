Luke Skywalker - ENTP
---------------------
[BG] Dominated by Blue and Green, his image shows he is idealistic and logical -- and a bit like Thomas Jefferson [INTP]
[B] When his adoptive parents are murdered in cold blood, he learns how to use The Force and his mind to control matter
[G] Luke is rational like his father, but different in the other Jungian aspects of personality

Darth Vader - ISTJ
------------------
[GR] Dominated by Green and Red, his image shows he is very stubborn -- a bit like Alexander Hamilton [ESTJ] but more emotional
[Y] As Obi-Wan Kenobi's Padawan apprentice, he sees his Jedi training as being more of a chore than a path to enlightenment
[G] Vader is cold-hearted and stubbornly decisive
