This is the first of about 30 posts I will be sharing on the most popular social networks of our time, at a rate of 1-3 per day for about three weeks, mostly during weekdays.  Yes, I have a plan!
If you'd like to see the other 29 or so, please find me at one of the accounts listed below.
Here is an overview of what I will be posting.  Each main post is followed by a fullsized image of each individual image + maybe 1-2 similar images.

Visualizing Colorfully Warm Personalities - George Washington and Joe Biden + Amy Klobuchar
Visualizing Extremely Serious Personalities - Alexander Hamilton and Mitch McConnell
Visualizing Deep and Deeper Personalities - Thomas Jefferson and Bernie Sanders + Nancy Pelosi
Visualizing Decidedly Passionate Personalities - Patrick Henry and Donald Trump
Visualizing Colorfully Serious Personalities - John Adams, Elizibeth Warren, and Mike Pence + Kamala Harris and Steve Bannon (FYI, Steve's personality is not as colorful as the others)
Visualizing Lifelong Learners' Personalities - Ben Franklin and Cory Booker
Visualizing Extremely Rare Personalities - Daenerys Targaryen [sic] and Pete Buttigieg
Visualizing My Personality - see how I have changed from my first self-portrait in 1987 to the lastest done this summer

My goal is to be objective and, if and when I get opinionated, try to be as positive as possible.  Of course, sometimes people take things the wrong way, such is life.  Moreover though, if you are looking for negativity and partisanship, look elsewhere.
I will be posting the same series of images to each of these accounts, so find me on multiple sites only if you are looking to boost your connection count.  Yes I will follow back as appropriate, most def!
