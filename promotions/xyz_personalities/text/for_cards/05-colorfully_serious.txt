Colorfully Serious Personalities

[Text left font]
These are images of the personalities of John Adams, Elizabeth
Warren, and Mike Pence.  Their images are colorful but show
they have a tendency to be cool-headed and principled.

The personalities of Kamala Harris and Michael Bennet are
remarkably similar to the personalities of these three
colorfully serious people.

John, Elizabeth, and Mike have slight preferences, but tend to be
reasonable and motivated by their ideals.

All three went to law school, and their balanced tendencies show
they can apply abstract legal concepts to the facts of the case,
and can debate logically while understanding peoples' emotions.

Steve Bannon has similar preferences, but they are much more extreme.
