Personalities

[Text left font]
These are images of the personalities of Daenerys Targaryen,
a character on the show Game of Thrones, and Pete Buttigieg.
They have colorful, flexible, yet warm and deep personalities.

[Text left font]
Daenerys and Pete care about the well-being of all people, and
their egalitarian ideals provide the foundation for their empathy.
Dany is a little warmer than Pete, who tends to be a little cooler.

I have analysed and drawn hundreds of personalities, and am
finding this particlar combination of traits to be very rare.
