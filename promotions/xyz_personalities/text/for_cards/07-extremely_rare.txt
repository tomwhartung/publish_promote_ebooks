Khaleesi's and Pete's Personalities

[Text left font]
These are images of the personalities of Daenerys Targaryen,
a character on the show Game of Thrones, and Pete Buttigieg.
They have colorful, flexible, yet very rare personalities.

The driving force behind Daenerys' and Pete's idealism is their
deep underlying compassion for all people.  Of course, while
Dany is strictly fictional, Pete is quite real.

[slightly larger font]
I have analysed and drawn hundreds of personalities, and am
finding this particlar combination of traits to be very rare.
