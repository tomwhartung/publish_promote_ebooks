Personality

[Text left font]
These are images of my personality, from 1987 when I wrote the
first version of the Groja (c) program, and 2019.  They show I have
become deeper and warmer over the past thirty-two years.

 Different: I am warmer, more like Cory and Patrick
 Super cool fact: as a Tom growing up in Virginia, I greatly admired Thomas Jefferson!

These images show my personality has remained the same but grown a little more extreme.
Since I have been working on this project full-time for the past several years, I am always thinking about these abstract qualities of everyone's personality.
So this slight transformation makes perfect sense.
