My Personality - 7/7

[smaller font]
These are images of my personality, from over thirty years ago and just last summer.
They show I have gone from being more flexible to being deeper and warmer since deciding to work on this project full-time.

 Different: I am warmer, more like Cory and Patrick
 Super cool fact: as a Tom growing up in Virginia, I greatly admired Thomas Jefferson!

These images show my personality has remained the same but grown a little more extreme.
Since I have been working on this project full-time for the past several years, I am always thinking about these abstract qualities of everyone's personality.
So this slight transformation makes perfect sense.
