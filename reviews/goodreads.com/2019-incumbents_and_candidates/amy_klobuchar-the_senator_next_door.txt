<i><u>The Senator Next Door, A Memoir From the Heartland</u></i> is an autobiography written by Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, and published in 2015.  It covers her whole life, from when she was born - and John Kennedy was elected president - in 1960, all the way up to when the book was published in the recent past.

<i><u>The Senator Next Door</u></i> is one of the almost twenty books about politicians I read in the summer of 2019 while researching a book about incumbents, candidates, and other politicians.  I am giving this book 3 of 5 stars because, although it is a genuine, first-person account, Amy's life is less interesting than some of the other candidates' lives.

As a city-dweller, I admit this rating may reflect some bias on my part for stories set in more urban environments.  In other words, to be perfectly honest, I admit to finding small town lives less interesting than lives lived in the big cities.  Now you know!

The most entertaining thing I found in Amy Klobuchar's book is when she tells of completing her college application at the tender age of 17.  Writing in an essay entitled <i><u>A Different Look at the Law,</u></i> she <i>"mentioned watching Perry Mason reruns, my attraction to the legal profession as portrayed on TV, and my fascination with how, at the end of the courtroom shows, 'goodness always prevailed'"</i> [p. 70].  I too, enjoy a good courtroom drama, and have wondered for decades what the personality of Perry Mason and his costars might look like - but I digress....

On a more serious note, the most enlightening thing I learned from Amy's autobiography is the decision-making process she used when picking a law school.
<blockquote><i>While Yale [where she had gone to undergraduate school] is known for its liberal bent, the University of Chicago Law School was and is known for being a pretty conservative place.  I liked the idea of going to school where I would be exposed to different ideas and different people.  I wanted to be somewhere that would take me out of my comfort zone.</i>
 &mdash; From <i><u>The Senator Next Door</u></i>, by Amy Klobuchar, 2015, p. 71.</blockquote>
As someone who consumes a variety of news sources, it is good to see someone deliberately embrace opposing points of view.  In fact, this single revealing quote convinces me that Amy could be as good a president as any of the other candidates - or indeed anyone else, for that matter.

After reading Amy Klobuchar's autobiography, I created a profile for her and included her spiritual portrait in my ebook <i><u><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XYHQ16R" title="Link to buy the book on amazon">Visualizing Politicians' Personalities, 2019 Incumbents and Candidates</a></u></i> I based the abstract image of Amy's personality in the ebook on this book, so it of course contains more about <i><u>The Senator Next Door, A Memoir From the Heartland</u></i> - in case you are interested.
