<i><u>Bernie Sanders Guide to Political Revolution</u></i> is a book written by Senator Bernie Sanders - a Democrat from Vermont - and published in 2017.  The book details the author's stance on eight of the important political issues of the day, and includes chapters on topics such as health care, climate change, and immigration.

<i><u>Guide to Political Revolution</u></i> is one of the almost twenty books about politicians I read in the summer of 2019 while researching a book about incumbents, candidates, and other politicians.

I am giving the book 5 of 5 stars because it is direct, logical, to-the-point, and leaves no doubt about how Bernie Sanders stands on the most important issues of the day.  Readers do not have to agree with an author - I for one am agnostic on just about everything political, <i>and that's why I keep reading</i> - to appreciate a writer's dedication to their ideals and the hard work they put in towards achieving them.

Bernie Sanders is, like members of the Libertarian and Green parties, very idealistic.  In my experience, the news media is a horrible place to learn about idealistic people.  An expansive vision cannot be reduced to sound bites, and even a deep focus on one or two issues can never do justice to the gestalt of a truly grand vision.

If you want to understand Bernie Sanders, read this book.  It's very short, and took me only about a day to read it, while the other books I read for this project easily took twice that and more.

The most surprising thing I learned from this book is that Bernie Sanders' proposals - and his proposed methods for funding and implementing them - are quite logical.  To see the logic in them, though, you <b>really</b> need to understand <b>all</b> of them.  And there is no better source of information on Bernie than the man - the visionary - himself!

Following is a list of the chapters in his book, copied straight from the Table of Contents.
<blockquote><i>1. Guaranteeing a Livable Wage and a Decent Life
2. Real Tax Reform
3. Reforming Wall Street
4. Health Care for All
5. Making Higher Education Affordable
6. Combating Climate Change
7. We need Real Policing and Criminal Justice Reform
8. Immigration Reform Now</i>

After reading <i><u>Guide to Political Revolution,</u></i> and another short book by Harry Jaffe named <i><u>Why Bernie Sanders Matters,</u></i>I created a profile for Bernie.  His spiritual portrait now appears in my new ebook <i><u><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XYHQ16R" title="Link to buy the book on amazon" target="_blank">Visualizing Politicians' Personalities, 2019 Incumbents and Candidates</a></u></i>.  Because I based the abstract image of Bernie's personality in the ebook on this book and the one by Harry Jaffe, the ebook contains more about both books - in case you are interested.
