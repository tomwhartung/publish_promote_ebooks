<i><u>Why Bernie Sanders Matters</u></i> is a biography of the popular presidential candidate, written by Harry Jaffe and published in 2015.  It covers Bernie's life from his childhood to the middle of this decade, and in the <i><u>Introduction</u></i> the author claims it <i>"is the first unauthorized biography of the senator who wants to be president"</i> [p. xi].

This book is one of the nearly twenty books about politicians I read in the summer of 2019 while researching a book I have written about incumbents, candidates, and other politicians.  I am giving <i><u>Why Bernie Sanders Matters</u></i> 4 of 5 stars because it is thorough and well-written, but lacks the first-person narrative and authenticity of some of the other biographies and autobiographies I read for this project.

The most remarkable thing I learned about Bernie from this book is the consistency of his message throughout his career.  Author Harry Jaffe quotes some of Bernie's opening remarks during the Democratic Party's presidential debate on November 14, 2015, during which he rants about America's <i>"rigged economy."</i>
<blockquote><i>People are working longer hours for lower wages, and almost all of the new income and wealth goes to the top one percent.</i>
 - Bernie Sanders, quoted in <i><u>Why Bernie Sanders Matters</u></i> [p. 186].</blockquote>
The author states Bernie <i>"needed no notes or teleprompter"</i> because it was <i>"a speech he has been giving in one form or another since 1981"</i> [p. 186].  How many other candidates have maintained a consistent stance - for close to four decades - on the issues?

After reading Harry Jaffe's book, and another short book written by Bernie entitled <i><u>Guide to Political Revolution</u></i>, I created a profile for him.  Bernie's spiritual portrait now appears in my new ebook <i><u><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XYHQ16R" title="Link to buy the book on amazon" target="_blank">Visualizing Politicians' Personalities, 2019 Incumbents and Candidates</a></u></i>.  Because I based the abstract image of Bernie's personality in the ebook on Harry Jaffe's book, it contains more about <i><u>Why Bernie Sanders Matters</u></i> - in case you are interested.
