<i><u>Fire and Fury</u></i> and <i><u>Siege</u></i> are books by Michael Wolff published in 2018.  Both books give readers an insider's view of the early days of the presidency of Donald Trump.

<i><u>Fire and Fury</u></i> and <i><u>Siege</u></i> are two of the nearly twenty books about politicians I read in the summer of 2019 while researching a book about incumbents, candidates, and other politicians.  Michael Wolff's books would sometimes come up in searches for biographies, and my curiosity about them increased until I finally decided to read them.

I am giving the pair of books an average score 4 of 5 stars because at this time goodreads does not list them individually.  If I could rate them separately, I would give <i><u>Fire and Fury</u></i> 5 of 5 stars and <i><u>Siege</u></i> 3 of 5 stars, because I liked the first book a lot but found the second book to be mostly just more of the same.

On the surface, Michael Wolff's language in these books is objective &mdash; not overly condescending or judgmental &mdash; but he does not paint a very positive picture of the Trump administration.  From the start of his coverage of the campaign in 2016 to the government shutdown in December of 2018 at the end of <i><u>Siege</u></i> the author portrays Donald and his supporters as being overwhelmed and underskilled.

The author's portrait is not unsympathetic, though.  After about 100 pages I found myself feeling sorry for many of the people in Donald Trump's orbit &mdash; especially his close family and mainstream Republicans.

My favorite chapter in the books is Chapter 16, entitled <i><u>Comey</u>,</i> of the first book, <i><u>Fire and Fury</u>.</i>  Michael Wolff writes that, when Donald fired the FBI director it was <i>"the most consequential move ever made by a modern president acting entirely on his own"</i> [p. 216].

Amazingly, Trump <i>"had forced [Rod] Rosenstein and [Jeff] Sessions to construct a legal rationale"</i> [p. 220] for firing James Comey &mdash; then decided to do it himself.  The author asserts Donald insisted on doing this himself because <i>"Cruelty was a Trump attribute."</i> [p. 218].
<blockquote><i>Having enlisted Rosenstein and Sessions in his plot, Trump now exposed their efforts to present a reasonable and aboveboard case as a sham - and, arguably, a plan to obstruct justice.</i>
 &mdash; From <i><u>Fire and Fury</u></i>, by Michael Wolff, p. 220.</blockquote>
Reading Michael Wolff's books encouraged me to read <i><u>Devil's Bargain</u></i> by Joshua Green, and ultimately inspired me to add Steve Bannon's spiritual portrait as a Bonus Profile to my ebook <i><u><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Visualizing-Politicians-Personalities-Incumbents-Candidates-ebook/dp/B07XYHQ16R/">Visualizing Politicians' Personalities, 2019 Incumbents and Candidates</a></u>.</i>  The bonus chapter includes a section looking at how the vastly different personalities of Donald Trump and Steve Bannon combined to get candidate Trump &mdash; who trailed in the polls yet still managed to overcome incredible obstacles &mdash; win the presidential election in 2016.

The content for Steve and Donald in the Bonus Profile chapter naturally contains more about <i><u>Fire and Fury</u></i> - in case you are interested.
