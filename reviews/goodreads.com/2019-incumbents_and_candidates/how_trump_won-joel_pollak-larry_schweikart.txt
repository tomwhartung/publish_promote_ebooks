<i><u>How Trump Won, The Inside Story of a Revolution</u></i> is a book by Joel Pollak and Larry Schweikart published in 2017.  It is about Donald Trump's campaign for president in 2016.

<i><u>How Trump Won</u></i> is one of the nearly twenty books about politicians I read in the summer of 2019 while researching a book about incumbents, candidates, and other politicians.  I am giving <i><u>How Trump Won</u></i> 2 of 5 stars because it is enlightening and informative, but also extremely partisan and presents only a conservative point-of-view.

In this book, the two authors write alternating chapters.  In the odd-numbered chapters Larry Schweikart provides a historical perspective for Donald's win of the presidency, while in the even-numbered chapters Joel Pollak shares his impressions as a member of the press corps following Donald Trump on the campaign trail.

The most remarkable thing I gained from this book is a sense of how hard Donald Trump worked to get elected.  Frequently holding multiple rallies per day - especially towards the end - Joel Pollak makes it clear that Donald put a lot of personal effort into his time on the campaign trail.  Donald and I do not think alike, but I have to respect people willing to put in the effort needed to get what they want.

I quote Larry Schweikart in my ebook <i><u><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Visualizing-Politicians-Personalities-Incumbents-Candidates-ebook/dp/B07XYHQ16R/">Visualizing Politicians' Personalities, 2019 Incumbents and Candidates</a></u></i> because he makes the astounding claim that Barack Obama was elected not on his merits, but rather because he is black.
How Larry can think he knows what millions of Americans think is beyond me!

Larry Schweikart's view is antithetical to mine, and in my own ebook &mdash; available exclusively via the link in the previous paragraph &mdash; I use his assertion as an example of how we have a ways to go if we are going to realize the vision Martin Luther King articulated in his <i>"<u>I Have a Dream Speech</u>,"</i> given over fifty years ago.

I found <i><u>How Trump Won</u></i> interesting and enlightening, but the obsession with political polls and sub-demographics was frequently tedious, and Larry Schweikart's observations were occasionally a bit disturbing &mdash; if indeed not blatantly racist &mdash; so I cannot in good faith say I enjoyed it.
