<i><u>Joe Biden, A Life of Trial and Redemption</u></i> is a biography of the former Vice President written by Jules Witcover and published in 2010.  It covers Joe's whole life, starting with his birthday on November 20th, 1942 and running up to the beginning of his work as Barack Obama's Vice President in 2010.

<i><u>Joe Biden, A Life of Trial and Redemption</u></i> is one of the nearly twenty books about politicians I read in the summer of 2019 while researching a book about incumbents, candidates, and other politicians.  I am giving the book 3 of 5 stars because, although it is thorough, it is a little dated, a bit longer than the others I read for this project, and the author quotes other books extensively rather than summarizing them in his own words.

One of the most amazing things I learned reading this book is that Joe was elected to the senate in 1972 when he was just 29 - and technically too young to serve.  He turned 30 on November 20th, 1972, but tragedy struck before he was able to take office.

While Joe was in Washington, D.C. preparing to start his first term in the Senate in January, 1973, his wife and their three children were involved in an automobile accident in suburban Wilmington, Delaware.  Although the two boys Beau and Hunter survived, Joe's wife <i>"Neilia and the baby were pronounced dead on arrival"</i> [p. 93].

It took Joe years to recover from his loss, but he managed to pull himself back from total despair and resume his life.  The loss of his wife and her young child is, of course, one of the biggest of the <i>"trials"</i> referred to in the book's title.

After reading Jules Witcover's book about Joe Biden, I created a profile for him and included his spiritual portrait in my ebook <i><u><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XYHQ16R">Visualizing Politicians' Personalities, 2019 Incumbents and Candidates.</a></u></i>  I based the abstract image of Joe's personality in the ebook on this book, so it of course contains more about <i><u>Joe Biden, A Life of Trial and Redemption</u></i> - in case you are interested.
