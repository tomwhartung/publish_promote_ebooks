<i><u>The Land of Flickering Lights, Restoring America in an Age of Broken Policies</u></i> is by Senator Michael Bennet - a Democrat and the senior senator from Colorado - and was published in 2019.  Chapter 1 of the book contains some background information, but the rest of it focuses on his time in the senate, which he has served in since 2009.

<i><u>The Land of Flickering Lights</u></i> is one of the nearly twenty books about politicians I read in the summer of 2019 while researching a book about incumbents, candidates, and other politicians.  It is different from the others in that, like an autobiography it contains the author's personal observations, but unlike autobiographies and biographies it focuses on the recent past - looking specifically at the current dysfunction in Congress.

I am giving the book 5 of 5 stars because it is personal, authentic, and seeks to fix problems rather than just point them out and criticize the system from a position of presumed superiority.  <b>Minor spoiler alert:</b> Michael and I agree that we can find hope by looking back to the ideals of America's Founding Fathers.

The bulk of the book starts in the second chapter and contains Michael's first-hand account of five episodes in which he feels our government failed to adequately serve the American people.

&mdash; Chapter 2, <i><u>Power Play,</u></i> describes <i>"when Senate Republicans abused the filibuster to effectively freeze his [President Obama's] nominees,"</i> leading to <i>"a cycle of preemptive retaliation"</i> [p. 24].

&mdash; In Chapter 3, <i><u>The Corruption of Inaction,</u></i> the author <i>"tracks the Republican Party's departure from its relatively honorable legacy on the environment to embrace an ideology of denial."</i>  The senator writes of how he can see his colleagues' motivations, <i>"explaining this devolution by pointing to the way our campaign finance system has corrupted Congress"</i> [p. 25].

&mdash; In Chapter 4, <i><u>Giving Away the Store,</u></i> he <i>"chronicles how an insurgent faction of Republicans"</i> who <i>"claimed to revere the framers and American political institutions"</i> came to use <i>"government shutdowns and debt-ceiling showdowns to impose their highly divisive factional will"</i> [p. 25].

&mdash; In Chapter 5, <i><u>No Prophets in Our Time,</u></i> the author <i>"examines the Obama administration's nuclear agreement with Iran"</i> and bemoans how <i>"The vast majority of Republicans opposed the deal even before studying it"</i> [p. 26].

&mdash; In Chapter 6, <i><u>The Test of a Free People,</u></i> the last episode <i>"considers one example of effective bipartisan legislating in the Senate - the work undertaken by the Senate's <u>Gang of Eight</u> several years ago to pass comprehensive immigration reform"</i> [p. 26].

While the bulk of Michael Bennet's book is about the dysfunction in Congress, it is not all negativity and finger-pointing.  In Chapters 7, 8, and 9 the author examines <i><u>Acting Like Founders,</u></i> proposes <i><u>Four Freedoms,</u></i> and discusses <i><u>The American Dream.</u></i>

Michael's book is clearly partisan - and just as clearly moderate.  As a Democrat, he finds attempts to work with Republicans to be frustrating.  Note though that the very existence of his book makes it clear he wants to work with conservatives to at least provide a minimum of services - to at least keep the lights on.

<i><u>The Land of Flickering Lights</u></i> concludes with a list of books <i><u>For Further Reading.</u></i>  It starts with some recommendations of works by the Founding Fathers and includes suggestions of works by a wide variety of other <i>"American Founders"</i> such as Walt Whitman, Susan B. Anthony, and Martin Luther King.  In the final pages of this last chapter the author suggests a few more works by authors such as Plutarch and Marcus Aurelius.

After reading Michael Bennet's book, I created a profile for him and included his spiritual portrait in my ebook <i><u><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XYHQ16R" title="Link to buy the book on amazon" target="_blank">Visualizing Politicians' Personalities, 2019 Incumbents and Candidates</a></u>.</i>  Because I based the abstract image of Michael Bennet's personality in the ebook on his book, it naturally contains more about <i><u>The Land of Flickering Lights, Restoring America in an Age of Broken Policies</u></i> - in case you are interested.
