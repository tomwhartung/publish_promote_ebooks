<i><u>The Long Game, A Memoir</u></i> is a memoir by Mitch McConnell published in 2016.  It covers Mitch's entire life, from his fight against polio in 1944 at the age of two through his becoming the Senate Majority Leader in 2015.

<i><u>The Long Game</u></i> is one of the nearly twenty books about politicians I read in the summer of 2019 while researching a book about incumbents, candidates, and other politicians.  I am giving the book 4 of 5 stars because, although Mitch's story is interesting and inspiring, I enjoyed some of the others a bit more.

The most amazing thing about this book is Mitch's determination.  He writes of a day in 1965, shortly after he started law school, when he went with John Sherman Cooper - who was at the time one of the Senators from Kentucky - to witness President Lyndon Johnson sign the <i><u>Voting Rights Act of 1965.</u></i>

The memory of this stuck with him while he finished law school and found work in Louisville, Kentucky.
<blockquote><i>Having seen in John Sherman Cooper what a life lived in pursuit of greatness could yield, I knew I had a very specific and far greater ambition: to follow in his footsteps, to become a US senator.</i>
 - From <i><u>The Long Game</u></i> by Mitch McConnell, 2016, pp. 38-39.</blockquote>
It would be over ten years before Mitch would win his first election and become Jefferson County Judge in 1977, and almost twenty years before he would become a senator in 1985.  Mitch went on to win the next five elections and rise to be Senate Majority Leader thirty years after that, in 2015.

After reading Mitch McConnell's memoir I created a profile for him and included his spiritual portrait in my ebook <i><u><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XYHQ16R" title="Link to buy the book on amazon" target="_blank">Visualizing Politicians' Personalities, 2019 Incumbents and Candidates</a></u>.</i>  I based the abstract image of Mitch's personality in the ebook on this book, so it of course contains more about <i><u>The Long Game, A Memoir</u></i> - in case you are interested.
