<i><u>Jesus and Personality Theory: Exploring the Five-Factor Model</u></i> is a book by James R. Beck published in 1999.
The author has a PhD, is a licensed clinical psychologist, and has been a Senior Professor of Counseling at the Denver Seminary since 1984.

James Beck wrote the book for Christian counselors.
It discusses the five factor model of personality while looking at the life of Jesus Christ.

The main reason I read <i><u>Jesus and Personality Theory</u></i> was to learn more about this theory of personalities.
Only about 15-20% of it is about the theory, while most of it is about Jesus.
I am not super-religious but enjoyed the book nonetheless, because it focuses on the ideas and other positive aspects Christianity rather than the divisiveness and other aspects I find to be so negative at times.

I am giving <i><u>Jesus and Personality Theory</u></i> 4 of 5 stars because, although I thoroughly enjoyed it, it ended rather abruptly.
Also, it has no index, making it less useful as a reference.


The five factor model of personality is also known as the <i><u>Big Five</u></i> set of personality traits.


The bulk of the book consists of five chapters, one for each of the five factors.  It is easiest to remember these using the acronym <b>OCEAN.</b>

<u><b>O</b>penness</u> &mdash; how open we are to new ideas
<u><b>C</b>onscientiousness</u> &mdash; how ordered and driven we are
<u><b>E</b>xtraversion</u> &mdash; the strength of our response to positive emotions
<u><b>A</b>greeableness</u> &mdash; how much empathy we have for others
<u><b>N</b>euroticism</u> &mdash; the strength of our response to negative emotions
