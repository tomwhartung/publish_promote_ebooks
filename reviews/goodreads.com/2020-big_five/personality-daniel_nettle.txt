<i><u>Personality, What Makes You the Way You Are</u></i> is a book by Daniel Nettle published in 2007.  He wrote it for people who want to learn more about the five factor model of understanding personalities.

I am giving <i><u>Personality</u></i> 5 of 5 stars because it is the first book I have had the opportunity to read about what some call the <i><u>"Big Five"</u></i> personality factors.  To say that I found it <i>"enlightening"</i> would be an understatement.  In truth, I am sure it will forever change how I view myself and others.

I read <i><u>Personality</u></i> to learn more about personalities, because I like to visualize and draw them.  The model for personalities I currently use for visualization is based on Jungian Archetypes, which also forms the basis for the highly popular <i><u>Myers-Briggs Type Indicator </u></i> or <i><u>MBTI&reg;</u></i>

It is now abundantly clear to me that the five factor model is more comprehensive &mdash; perhaps even dangerously so.

Someone answering a questionnaire based on Jungian Archetypes can take comfort in the fact that there <i>no right or wrong answers.</i> This is not necessarily true for questionnaires based on the five factor model, because it can identify real pathologies.  Some people spend their whole lives studying and treating these pathologies, and when present they require the attention of a professional.  At this time, how I integrate this unpleasant aspect of this model into my images is an open question.

In addition to describing the processes researchers have used to identify these factors and codify this model, Nettle includes some insights from evolutionary psychology.  He also discusses some of the brain imaging experiments scientists have used to discover a neurological basis for personality.

The author revisits these themes again at the end of the book and discusses the results of studies of twins.  Throughout the book &mdash; <b>minor spoiler alert</b> &mdash; he makes a very strong case for how we inherit much of makes up our personalities.

The bulk of the book consists of five chapters, one for each of the five factors.  It is easiest to remember these using the acronym <b>OCEAN.</b>

<u><b>O</b>penness</u> &mdash; how open we are to new ideas
<u><b>C</b>onscientiousness</u> &mdash; how ordered and driven we are
<u><b>E</b>xtraversion</u> &mdash; the strength of our response to positive emotions
<u><b>A</b>greeableness</u> &mdash; how much empathy we have for others
<u><b>N</b>euroticism</u> &mdash; the strength of our response to negative emotions

There's plenty about the five factor model on the wikipedia, but it is quite dry.  Daniel Nettle's book is way better!

The Appendix includes a 12-question quiz called the <i><u>Newcastle Personality Assessor</u></i> or <i><u>NPA.</u></i>  Anyone who knows me well will see how I could score high on Openness, medium high on Conscientiousness and Agreeableness, and low on Extraversion and Neuroticism.

I highly recommend <i><u>Personality, What Makes You the Way You Are</u></i> by Daniel Nettle to anyone interested in learning more about themself and others.

As far as I'm concerned it makes the old Jungian Archetypes model seem <i>"strictly bush league"</i> in comparison.
