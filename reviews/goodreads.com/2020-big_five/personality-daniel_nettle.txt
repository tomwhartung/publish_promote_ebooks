<i><u>Personality, What Makes You the Way You Are</u></i> is a book by Daniel Nettle published in 2007.
Daniel Nettle wrote it for people who want to learn more about the five factor model of understanding personalities.

I am giving <i><u>Personality</u></i> 5 of 5 stars because it is the first book I have had the opportunity to read about what some call the <i><u>"Big Five"</u></i> personality factors.
To say that I found it <i>"enlightening"</i> would be an understatement.


I read <i><u>Personality</u></i> to learn more about personalities, because I like to visualize and draw them.
The model for personalities that I currently use is based on Jungian Archetypes, and it is clear that the five factor model is more comprehensive &mdash; perhaps even dangerously so.


In addition to describing the processes researchers have used to come up with this model and including some insights from evolutionary psychology, Nettle discuss some of the brain imaging experiments scientists have used.
He revisits these themes again at the end of the book and discusses the results of studies of twins.
Throughout the book &mdash; <b>minor spoiler alert</b> &mdash; he makes a very strong case for how we inherit much of makes up our personalities.

The bulk of the book consists of devotes an entire chapter to each of the five factors.
It is easiest to remember these using the acronym <b>OCEAN.</b>

<u><b>O</b>penness</u> &mdash; how open we are to new ideas
<u><b>C</b>onscientiousness</u> &mdash; how ordered and driven we are internally motivated to be
<u><b>E</b>xtraversion</u> &mdash; strength of our response to positive emotions
<u><b>A</b>greeableness</u> &mdash; how much empathy we have for others
<u><b>N</b>euroticism</u> &mdash; strength of our response to negative emotions

There's plenty about the Big Five on the wikipedia, but it is quite dry.
Daniel Nettle's book is way better.

The Appendix includes a 12-question quiz called the <i><u>Newcastle Personality Assessor</u></i> or <i><u>NPA.</u></i>
Anyone who knows me well will agree with my score of high on Openness, medium high on Conscientiousness and Agreeableness, and low on Extraversion and Neuroticism.

I highly recommend <i><u>Personality, What Makes You the Way You Are</u></i>, by Daniel Nettle to anyone interested in learning more about themself and others.

It makes the old Jungian Archetypes model seem <i>"strictly bush league"</i> in comparison.
