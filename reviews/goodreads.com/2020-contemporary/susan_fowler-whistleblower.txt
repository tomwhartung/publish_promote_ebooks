<i><u>Whistleblower, My Journey to Silicon Valley and Fight for Justice at Uber</u></i> is a memoir by Susan Fowler published in 2020.
It covers her whole life, but a bit over half of it is about the harassment, discrimination, and abuse she and other employees faced working at Uber.


I am giving <i><u>Whistleblower</u></i> 5 of 5 stars because it is an inspiring and excellent story of courage, and the dangers and rewards of speaking truth to power.


Susan's revelations begin with her growing up living in poverty in rural Arizona.
In Chapter 1 she writes of having six brothers and sisters, and at one point she heard <i>"my mother telling my father that they'd made five thousand dollars that year"</i> [p. 8].


Susan was homeschooled but had a voracious appetite for learning and, through determination and hard work, managed to get into Arizona State University and later into the University of Pennsylvania.
At Penn Susan <i>"was on track to graduate with three degrees: a BA in physics, a BA in philosophy, and an MA in philosophy"</i> [p. 54] when she befriended <i>"a new student named Tim"</i> [p. 55].

Tim <i>"seemed to have trouble fitting in, so I reached out to him, hoping I could help him become part of the group."</i> [p. 55].
She learned this was a huge mistake when he <i>"told me he had romantic feelings for me"</i> and, when she told him she was not attracted to him,
<i>"he said he was going to kill himself"</i> [p. 58].

Susan talked to the police and a wide variety of school administrators &mdash; including the dean of graduate studies &mdash; but the situation continued to escalate,
In an unbelievably unconscionable act of retaliation Penn <i>"rescinded my master's degree in philosophy, on the grounds that I had withheld information"</i> [p. 63].

As her frustration increased, Susan eventually wound up spending <i>"hours reading about Title IX"</i> and <i>"realized that Penn had been gaslighting me the entire time"</i> [p. 66].
Ultimately she realized that she <i>"didn't speak up, because I was afraid"</i> and she <i>"vowed that I would never make the same mistake again."</i> [p. 69].


Putting this experience behind her, Susan moved to the San Francisco Bay Area and, after landing a couple of programming jobs, found work at Uber.
Her troubles there began on her first day, and only grew worse as she tried to fight the powers that be.

<blockquote><i>The abuse that I endured from my managers grew worse with every passing day.  I dreaded going into work, knowing that I'd be yelled at in meetings, that I'd be told I wasn't <q>doing my job,</q> that I wasn't <q>working hard enough,</q> even though I was doing everything that my managers asked of me.  I wasn't the only one who felt this way.  When I told my friends on the site reliability engineering teams what was going on, they said they had the same problems with their managers and teams, too.  Almost every single one of them had started seeing a therapist for anxiety or depress related to the culture of work at Uber; the engineers who'd been at Uber the longest all seemes to have suicidal thoughts.  This scared me, because I was starting to develop anxiety and PTSD from my work, too, and I didn't want my mental health to get worse.</i><br>&nbsp;&mdash; From <i><u>Whistleblower</u></i>, by Susan Fowler, pp. 153-154.</blockquote>

At one point Susan learned one of her colleagues, <i>"a black man named Joseph Thomas who had been bullied by his manager, was dead,"</i> having <i>"shot himself in his car"</i> [p. 164].
She was able to finally find a way out of Uber only by realizing that although she <i>"couldn't control what others did to me,"</i> she <i>"could control how I reacted"</i> [p. 168].


My favorite part of the book comes after she left Uber, when she describes herself deliberating on whether to publish her infamous blog post.
This brought to mind Michael Schur's show called <i><u>The Good Place,</u></i> in which the characters Eleanor, played by Kristen Bell and Chidi, played by William Jackson Harper, sometimes debate internally what is the right thing to do when confronted with tough options.

She desperately <i>"wanted to do what was right, and not just what was right for me, but what was <u>objectively</u> right"</i> [p. 202], and ultimately her experiences at Penn and her study of philosophy informed her choice.

<blockquote><i>I knew what was just, I knew what was truthful, I knew what was courageous, I knew what was right.  Standing up against injustice was right.  Refusing to give in to fear was right.  Telling the truth was right.  These things were right in every circumstance, regardless of the consequences.<br>I knew what I had to do.  I had to speak up.</i><br>&nbsp;&mdash; From <i><u>[Short title]</u></i>, by Susan Fowler, p. 203.</blockquote>


I truly enjoyed reading Susan Fowler's book and recommend it to everyone who is working in technology or considering a career in it, especially if you &mdash; like me &mdash; truly love programming and have no desire to go into management.
