<i><u>Whistleblower, My Journey to Silicon Valley and Fight for Justice at Uber</u></i> is a memoir by Susan Fowler published in 2020.
It covers her whole life, but a bit over half of it is about the harassment, discrimination, and abuse she and other employees faced working at Uber.


I am giving <i><u>Whistleblower</u></i> 5 of 5 stars because it is an inspiring and excellent story of courage, and the dangers and rewards of speaking truth to power.


Susan's revelations begin with her growing up living in poverty in rural Arizona.
In Chapter 1 she writes of having six brothers and sisters, and at one point she heard <i>"my mother telling my father that they'd made five thousand dollars that year"</i> [p. 8].


Susan was homeschooled but had a voracious appetite for learning and, through determination and hard work, managed to get into Arizona State University and later into the University of Pennsylvania.
At Penn Susan <i>"was on track to graduate with three degrees: a BA in physics, a BA in philosophy, and an MA in philosophy"</i> [p. 54] when she befriended <i>"a new student named Tim"</i> [p. 55].

Tim <i>"seemed to have trouble fitting in, so I reached out to him, hoping I could help him become part of the group."</i> [p. 55].
She learned this was a huge mistake when he <i>"told me he had romantic feelings for me"</i> and, when she told him she was not attracted to him,
<i>"he said he was going to kill himself"</i> [p. 58].

Susan talked to the police and a wide variety of school administrators, but the situation continued to escalate and Penn eventually <i>"rescinded my master's degree in philosophy, on the grounds that I had withheld information"</i> [p. 63].
As her frustration increased she wound up spending <i>"hours reading about Title IX"</i> she <i>"realized that Penn had been gaslighting me the entire time"</i> [p. 66].
