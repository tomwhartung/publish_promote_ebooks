Jeanne E. Abrams' 2018 book <i><u>First Ladies of the Republic</u></i> is about the first three First Ladies, Martha Washington, Abigail Adams, and Dolley Madison.
It made me appreciate how each of them approached their positions with a combination of humility and pride, and gave me a sense of how each of them brought their own unique talents to the office of the presidency.

America's first three presidencies brought severe partisanship to the new government.
George Washington is the only president who did not belong to a party, but by the end of his administration the Federalist and Democratic-Republican parties were well established &mdash; and deeply divided.

In this respect, the hostile political climate of the time was much like that today.
Jeanne writes of how the two parties were deeply divided and newspapers supported either one side or the other.
In those days women could not vote or hold office, but that does not mean these first three First Ladies were passive bystanders.

In addition to insight into the temperaments of the three First Ladies, another takeaway from Jeanne's book is the idea that anyone wanting to see peace between the two political parties should be looking at the candidates' spouses more than the candidates.
Near the end of <i><u>First Ladies of the Republic,</u></i> the author summarizes why I think this.

<blockquote><i>As has been noted, the ability of elite political women such as Martha Washington, Abigail Adams, and Dolley Madison to host and socialize with political players from both sides of the aisle in "quasi-public parlors" made them pivotal actors in the early republic arena.  They were often able to diffuse some of the significant polarizations between opposing parties.</i> &mdash; From <i><u>First Ladies of the Republic</u></i>, by Jeanne E. Abrams, p. 259.</blockquote>

Jeanne's book in general and this quote in particular make it clear to me that the right First Spouse could go a long way towards healing the deep divisions in today's political landscape.

I thoroughly enjoyed reading <i><u>First Ladies of the Republic,</u></i> and upon finishing it had a good start on understanding how the three were similar in some ways, but definitely also distinctly different individuals.  Where Martha was content to be supportive, Abigail took an active interest in her husband's work, and Dolley had <i>"a charismatic personality almost from birth"</i> [p. 203].

Clearly, what we need is another Dolley Madison!

I will be reading more about these three women right away, just as soon as I finish recommending this book to anyone interested in learning more about these three remarkable women.
