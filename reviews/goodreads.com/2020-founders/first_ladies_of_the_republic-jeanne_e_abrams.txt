Jeanne E. Abrams' 2018 book <i><u>First Ladies of the Republic</u></i> is about the first three First Ladies, Martha Washington, Abigail Adams, and Dolley Madison.
It made me appreciate how each of them approached their positions with a combination of humility and pride, and gave me a sense of how each of them brought their own unique talents to the office of the presidency.

In those days women could not vote or hold office, but that does not mean these first three First Ladies were passive bystanders.

In Chapter One the author relates that <i>"When Martha was present at social occasions, the ambiance was markedly improved."</i>
Furthermore she was <i>"especially sensitive to the needs of former Revolutionary War soldiers"</i> when <i>"they came to visit"</i> [p.73].


Jeanne goes on to tell of how Abigail, due to a number of factors, had an <i>"ever-present taste for her 'dish of politics'."</i>
The reasons she lists include Abigail's <i>"own keen intellect and ever-curious mind"</i> and <i>"her father William Smith,"</i> who <i>"had been a prominent Congregationalist minister"</i> as well as <i>"her maternal grandfather, John Quincy, an active politician"</i> [p. 199].


Chapter Four begins telling of how Dolley <i>"drew upon elements her predecessors had introduced "</i> yet took it one step further <i>"by astutely expanding her sphere of influence through intentional social interactions."</i>
Jeanne goes on to write this was only natural for her, because Dolley had <i>"a charismatic personality almost from birth"</i> [p. 203].


America's first three presidencies saw the creation of two parties in the new government &mdash; and a sharp divide develop between the two.
George Washington is the only president who did not belong to a party, but by the end of his administration the Federalist and Democratic-Republican parties were well established and deeply divided.

In this respect, the hostile political climate of the time was much like that today.
Jeanne writes of how the newspapers of the day supported either one party or the other.

In addition to insight into the temperaments of the three First Ladies, another takeaway from Jeanne's book is the idea that anyone wanting to see peace between the two political parties should be looking at the candidates' spouses more than the candidates.
Near the end of <i><u>First Ladies of the Republic,</u></i> the author summarizes why I think this.

<blockquote><i>As has been noted, the ability of elite political women such as Martha Washington, Abigail Adams, and Dolley Madison to host and socialize with political players from both sides of the aisle in "quasi-public parlors" made them pivotal actors in the early republic arena.  They were often able to diffuse some of the significant polarizations between opposing parties.</i> &mdash; From <i><u>First Ladies of the Republic</u></i>, by Jeanne E. Abrams, p. 259.</blockquote>

Jeanne's book in general and this quote in particular make it clear to me that the right First Spouse could go a long way towards healing the deep divisions in today's political landscape.

I thoroughly enjoyed reading <i><u>First Ladies of the Republic,</u></i> and upon finishing it had a good start on understanding how the three were similar in some ways, but definitely also distinctly different individuals.

Where Martha was happy to be friendly and supportive, and Abigail took an active interest in her husband's work, Dolley had <i>"a charismatic personality almost from birth"</i> [p. 203].


Clearly, what we need is another Dolley Madison!

I will be reading more about these three women right away, just as soon as I finish recommending this book to anyone interested in learning more about these three remarkable women.
