Mini-review from Fb post:
-------------------------
Thomas Paine was awesome, but most of his "friends" turned their backs on him by the time he died.  In addition to Common Sense, his Crisis series of essays was instrumental in helping Washington win the American Revolution.  He was a major inspiration for the French Revolution, but they had a falling out during the Reign of Terror, apparently due to language differences.  There was not a lot of logic in France in those days, and he barely escaped a date with Madame Guillotine.  He tried to help the English the way he helped Americans and French, but they were not really interested in liberating themselves from their monarchy.  Finally, he took on religious authority in his book Age of Reason, and that's when most people turned their backs on him.  I think there were maybe three people at his funeral.  Some people love their masters, even, or maybe especially, the invisible ones!  I think that's what is going on today in Russia with Putin, but I digress, and it's just a theory, and one that at best would be virtually impossible to prove at that.  But I see a pattern there, even in America today!
