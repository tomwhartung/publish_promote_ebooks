<i><u>Ties That Bound, Founding First Ladies and Slaves</u></i> is a book by Marie Jenkins Schwartz published in 2017.

Marie Jenkins Schwartz wrote it for people interested in learning about the slaves that worked in the households of three of the first four American Presidents.


I am giving <i><u>Ties That Bound</u></i> 5 of 5 stars because, for the first time in my life I really could get a feel for what day-to-day life was like back then.

It also helped to demythologize these founders in my mind, enabling me to see them more as real people.


Slavery is a serious subject, and I was never very comfortable reading the book.
My curiosity was stronger than my discomfort, so I pressed on, and am very glad I did.

Most of the book is quite serious, but I had to laugh at Martha and George Washington's disbelief when Martha's maid Oney Judge escaped.
Because <i>"the Washingtons' slaves in Philadelphia lived well in comparison to other bonded people,"</i> this was <i>"shocking to them"</i> [p. 106].


More enlightening is the author's revelations concerning Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings.
Apparently these interracial relationships were common, but rarely acknowledged in public.

By the time Jefferson became President, <i>"aversion toward interracial sex had been growing"</i> [p. 194], prompting the opposition press to pummel Jefferson for having this sort of relationship with his property.
At one point it got so bad that his daughter Patsy <i>"confronted her father with"</i> a very <i>"offensive bit of doggerel penned by Irish poet Thomas Moore."</i>

Jefferson in turn <i>"laughed and refused to discuss it,"</i> leaving her<i>" humiliated by the gossip and unable to respond"</i> [p. 199].
I have read several books about the founders, and this one is the first to say Jefferson laughed at something.
