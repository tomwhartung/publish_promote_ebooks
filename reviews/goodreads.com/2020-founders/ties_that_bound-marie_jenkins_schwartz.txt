<i><u>Ties That Bound, Founding First Ladies and Slaves</u></i> is a book by Marie Jenkins Schwartz published in 2017.  She wrote it for people interested in learning about the slaves that worked in the households of three of the first four American Presidents.

I am giving <i><u>Ties That Bound</u></i> 5 of 5 stars because it gave me, for the first time in my life, a feel for what day-to-day life was like back then.  It also helped to demythologize these founders in my mind, enabling me to see them more as real people with all too real flaws.

Slavery is a serious subject, and I was never very comfortable reading the book.  My curiosity was stronger than my discomfort, so I pressed on, and I'm very glad I did!

The seriousness of the subject aside, I had to laugh at Martha and George Washington's disbelief when Martha's maid Oney Judge managed to escape.  Because <i>"the Washingtons' slaves in Philadelphia lived well in comparison to other bonded people,"</i> this was <i>"shocking to them"</i> [p. 106].


More enlightening is the author's revelations concerning Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings.
Apparently these interracial relationships were common, but rarely acknowledged in public.
By the time Jefferson became President, <i>"aversion toward interracial sex had been growing"</i> [p. 194], prompting the opposition press to pummel Jefferson for having this sort of relationship with his property.


At one point it got so bad that his daughter Patsy <i>"confronted her father with"</i> a very <i>"offensive bit of doggerel penned by Irish poet Thomas Moore."</i>
Jefferson in turn <i>"laughed and refused to discuss it,"</i> leaving her<i>" humiliated by the gossip and unable to respond"</i> [p. 199].
I have read several books about the founders, and this one is the first I can recall saying Jefferson laughed at something.


Dolley Madison's experience with slavery is very interesting.
When still a child, her parents gave up their slaves to become Quakers.
Then after losing her first husband and marrying James, she once again became a slave owner.


The story about her cousin Edward Coles who <i>"decided as a young man that slaveholding was immoral"</i> [p. 306] is full of irony.
He visited the Madisons frequently in an effort to get them to free their slaves, but <i>"directed all of his powers of persuasion at James, not Dolley"</i> [p. 348].

As it turned out, Dolley outlived James and, towards the end of her life, wound up selling her slaves piecemeal.
In some instances this caused families to be separated, which was -- obviously, to most people anyway -- very painful for them.
Having been excluded from her cousin's pleas for empathy she <i>"was inclined to think of slaves in terms of what they did for her, rather than as sentient human beings"</i> [p. 316].
