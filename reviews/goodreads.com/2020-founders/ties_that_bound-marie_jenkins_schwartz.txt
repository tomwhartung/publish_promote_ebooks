<i><u>Ties That Bound, Founding First Ladies and Slaves</u></i> is a book by Marie Jenkins Schwartz published in 2017.

Marie Jenkins Schwartz wrote it for people interested in learning about the slaves that worked in the households of three of the first four American Presidents.


I am giving <i><u>Ties That Bound</u></i> 5 of 5 stars because, for the first time in my life I really could get a feel for what day-to-day life was like back then.

It also helped to demythologize these founders in my mind, enabling me to see them more as real people.
