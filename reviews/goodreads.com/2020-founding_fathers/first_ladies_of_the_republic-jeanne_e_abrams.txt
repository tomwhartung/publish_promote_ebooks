Jeanne E. Abrams' 2018 book <i><u>First Ladies of the Republic</u></i> is about the first three First Ladies, Martha Washington, Abigail Adams, and Dolley Madison.  Although George did not belong to a party, the Federalist and Democratic-Republican parties were well established by the time James Madison took office in 1809.

My main takeaway from Jeanne's book is that, in these times of extreme partisanship and deeply divided political parties, anyone desiring peace between the two sides should be looking at the candidates' spouses more than the candidates.

Jeanne writes that similar to the way things are today, the two parties were deeply divided and newspapers supported either one side or the other.  In our republic's earliest days women could not vote or hold office, but this does not mean these first three First Ladies were not passive bystanders.

Near the end of <i><u>First Ladies of the Republic,</u></i> the author summarizes the reason behind the <i>"main takeaway"</i> I mention above:

<blockquote><i>As has been noted, the ability of elite political women such as Martha Washington, Abigail Adams, and Dolley Madison to host and socialize with political players from both sides of the aisle in "quasi-public parlors" made them pivotal actors in the early republic arena.  They were often able to diffuse some of the significant polarizations between opposing parties.</i> &mdash; From <i><u>First Ladies of the Republic</u></i>, by Jeanne E. Abrams, p. 259.</blockquote>

Jeanne's book in general and this quote in particular make it clear to me that the right First Spouse could go a long way towards healing the deep divisions in today's political landscape.

I thoroughly enjoyed reading <i><u>First Ladies of the Republic,</u></i> and upon finishing it had a good start on understanding how the three were similar in some ways, but definitely also distinctly different individuals.  Where Martha was content to be supportive, Abigail took an active interest in her husband's work, and Dolley had <i>"a charismatic personality almost from birth"</i> [p. 203].

Clearly, what we need is another Dolley Madison!

I will be reading more about these three women right away, just as soon as I finish recommending this book to anyone interested in learning more about these three remarkable women.
