<i><u>Triggered, How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us</u></i> is a book by Donald Trump Jr. published in 2019.

Donald Trump Jr. wrote it for conservatives, unaffiliated voters, and Democrats who might be willing to vote for his father.
He wrote it in an effor to convince these voters to vote for his dad, Donald Trump Sr., in November, 2020.


I read <i><u>Triggered</u></i> together with <i><u>Minority Leader</u></i> by Stacey Adams so that I could learn about, analyze, and draw images of their personalities, for posting online and possible use in one of my own books.
Both of these books are a little outside my comfort level, but I have learned that pushing myself can yield unforseen yet very positive results.
As it turned out, I enjoyed both books a great deal more than expected, and at this time would recommend both to anyone looking for insight into America's current political climate.


Don Jr. and Stacey have very different backgrounds and belong to two increasingly contentious political parties.
The most interesting thing I learned from reading these books is that both authors agree that ambitious and elite politicians all too frequently overlook average people &mdash; people whom I like to call <q>the salt of the earth,</q> in reference to the classic Rolling Stones song of the same name.
