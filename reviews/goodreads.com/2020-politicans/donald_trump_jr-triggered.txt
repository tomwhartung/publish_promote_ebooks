<i><u>Triggered, How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us</u></i> is a book by Donald Trump Jr. published in 2019.

Donald Trump Jr. wrote it for conservatives, unaffiliated voters, and Democrats who might be willing to vote for his father.
He wrote it in an effor to convince these voters to vote for his dad, Donald Trump Sr., in November, 2020.


I read <i><u>Triggered</u></i> together with <i><u>Minority Leader</u></i> by Stacey Adams so that I could learn about, analyze, and draw images of their personalities, for posting online and possible use in one of my own books.
Both of these books are a little outside my comfort level, but I have learned that pushing myself can yield unforseen yet very positive results.
As it turned out, I enjoyed both books a great deal more than expected, and at this time would recommend both to anyone looking for insight into America's current political climate.


It is no secret that Don Jr. and Stacey have very different backgrounds and belong to two increasingly contentious political parties.
As it turned out, I enjoyed the contrast between the two &mdash; the culture shock of switching from one to the other &mdash; almost as much as I did the books themselves.


Ultimately the most interesting thing I learned from reading these books is both authors agree that ambitious business people and elite politicians all too frequently ignore the "little guy."
They both assert that all leaders should elicit the opinions of average people &mdash; people whom I like to call <q>the salt of the earth,</q> a biblical reference I like to associate with the classic Rolling Stones song of the same name.


Having never belonged to either major political party, I enjoyed reading about how the presumably diametrically opposed Donald Trump Jr. and Stacey Abrams agree on this aspect of leadership.


In Chapter 7, <i><u>Not Your Grandfather's Democrat Party,</u></i> Don Jr. writes about talking to a union member he calls <q>Rusty</q> while at a rally for Donald Sr.
He mentions Rusty <i>"had come from a long line of union people"</i> [p. 111] but, in voting for Democrats like Barack H. Obama, whom he claims <i>"took more money from the paychecks of blue-collar workers than any president since the Great Depression"</i> Rusty had been voting <i>"against his own self-interest.  It wasn't really his fault, though"</i> [p. 112].

A few pages later, in a section entitled <i><u>Blue-Collar Billionaire,</u></i> Don Jr. reveals how his <i><u>"father had gotten unheard-of levels of support from voters who belonged to labor unions" [p.115].

<blockquote><i>What all those morons with Ivy League jornalism degrees failed to see was right there in plain sight.  As I've often said, if you want to wear yourself out, follow Donald J. Trump around a job site someday.  My father doesn't just visit a construction project, he stays the whole day and comes back the next day.  By the time he's through, he knows most of the workers' names, every problem they've encountered, and just about exactly how much he's spent.</i>&nbsp;&mdash; From <i><u>Triggered</u></i>, by Donald Trump Jr., p. 115.</blockquote>


I am giving <i><u>Triggered</u></i> 3 of 5 stars because I found it refreshing to read an entire book without a single negative thing to say about Donald Trump Sr.
Anyone who knows me well knows my father and I have had our ups and downs, so I think it's great he admires his dad so much.

The downside is the audience for Don Jr's book is its audience is limited.
Indeed, Chapter 1 is entitled <i><u>Trigger Warning</u></i> and contains a list of the types of people who will not want to read it.

I encourage my more liberal friends who wonder how so many of our fellow Americans can support Donald Sr. to give it a chance, because there's a lot more there about our president than what can be found in the press.
