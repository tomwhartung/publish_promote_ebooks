<i><u>Bloomberg by Bloomberg</u></i> is an autobiography by Michael Bloomberg published in 2019.  It covers his entire life, but glosses over his childhood and most of it focuses on his career in business as an adult.

I am giving <i><u>Bloomberg by Bloomberg</u></i> 4 of 5 stars because it is an enlightening and positive story, but frankly a bit boring and even condescending in places.  The book is full of advice for people who seek to be successful in business, but because I have more of a creative bent, my interests have led me down a different path.  Sorry Michael, but not everyone can be happy working twelve-hour days six days a week.

The story behind <i><u>Bloomberg News</u></i> is the one thing I enjoyed learning the most from this book.  Now that I know about it, I have started noticing when non-Bloomberg sites feature their stories.  Having learned about the history, evolution, and goals of his service, I can appreciate and trust those stories more than I would otherwise.

Indeed, some of the things he writes about the media really hit home for me.  For example, on page 110 he states that <i>"As the media landscape has fragmented, so has society"</i> and laments how it has become more difficult <i>"to find and trust <q>real</q> news ... with facts backed by data and reporting free of partisan or ideological bias."</i>  Having read that, I now tend to notice articles sourced from Bloomberg.com, and so far am inclined to believe he is telling the truth.

Michael goes on to assert that because this impartiality and objectivity is becoming more of the exception than the rule, <i>"the more valuable it will become, and the better Bloomberg will do."</i> [p. 110].  He has an analytical mind, and it really when he goes on to describe the big picture &mdash; as he sees it &mdash; behind all this.
<blockquote><i>This breakdown in an accepted basis of fact has coincided with the rise in partisan media and the segregation, by political beliefs, of the American public.  Pundits talk past one another, and people gravitate to news outlets that will confirm their preexisting beliefs -- and the more bombastic the pundits, the more popular they are, and the more money their employers make.  For nearly all of history, from Socrates to Cronkite, news was written, organized, and desseminated by the educated and wealthy.  People didn't always like the news, but they mostly believed what they were hearing and reading.  They trusted news organizations to deliver facts and truths.  That world is gone.</i><br> &mdash; From <i><u>Bloomberg by Bloomberg</u></i>, by Michael Bloomberg, p. 110.</blockquote>

Although I found other parts of the book to be a bit tedious, I am sure there are others who would be interested in learning the story behind Michael's success.  Certainly anyone with an MBA, or an interest in attaining one, would find much more value in the many tips he offers for aspiring leaders.

The main reason I read this book was so I could analyze and draw an image of Michael's personality.
I invite anyone interested in seeing the resultant image to find me, "tomwhartung," on one of the main social networking sites, or check out my main website at <a href="seeourminds.com" title="Home page of seeourminds.com" target="_blank">seeourminds.com.</a>
