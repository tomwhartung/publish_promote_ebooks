<i><u>With All Due Respect, Defending America With Grit and Grace</u></i> is a memoir by Nikki R. Haley published in 2019.
It covers her whole life, but focuses on her time in politics as a legislator in and governor of South Carolina, and as her time as the United States Ambassador to the United Nations.


I am giving <i><u>With All Due Respect</u></i> 5 of 5 stars because I really enjoyed reading her story.
I found it to be inspirational and was impressed by the way Nikki can see through the veil of partisanship and focus on acting in the best interests of all Americans.

After reading Nikki R. Haley's book, I created a profile for [her, him, person, etc.] and included their spiritual portrait in my ebook <i><u><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Visualizing-Politicians-Personalities-Incumbents-Candidates-ebook/dp/B07XYHQ16R/">Visualizing Politicians' Personalities, 2019 Incumbents and Candidates.</a></u></i>
I based the abstract image of [person]'s personality in the ebook on this book, so it of course contains more about <i><u>With All Due Respect, Defending America With Grit and Grace</u></i> - in case you are interested.
