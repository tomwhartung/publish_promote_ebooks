<i><u>With All Due Respect, Defending America With Grit and Grace</u></i> is a memoir by Nikki R. Haley published in 2019.
It covers her whole life, but focuses on her time in politics as a legislator in and governor of South Carolina, and as her time as the United States Ambassador to the United Nations.


I am giving <i><u>With All Due Respect</u></i> 5 of 5 stars because I really enjoyed reading her story.
I found it to be inspirational and was impressed by the way Nikki can see through the veil of partisanship and focus on acting in the best interests of all Americans.


After a brief introduction to her childhood growing up <i>"in a small town in rural South Carolina"</i> as <i>"a brown girl in a black-and-white world "</i> [p. 11], Nikki's book dives right into the challenges she faced as Governor.

Chapter 1 is entitled <i><u>The Murders in Charleston</u></i> and describes the horror the state faced when a gunman opened fire in the Mother Emanual Church in Charleston.
This leads directly into Chapter 2, entitled <i><u>The Flag Comes Down,</u></i> in which she describes how she came to believe that the only fitting response to that horrific criminal act was to remove the Confederate Flag flying at the State Capitol, and how she worked to make that happen.


Most of the rest of the book is about her time as the United States Ambassador to the United Nations.
Nikki is not afraid to stand up to Donald Trump and tell him when she thinks he is wrong, and it is clear that he respects her for that.
She also recognizes that he is the President and ultimately needs to make his own decisions.


True Confession: I am a sucker for anyone from any political party who can put aside partisanship and declare their support for American ideals over everything else.
Nikki does precisely that more than once.
Here is an excellent example, taken from Chapter 9, entitled <i></u>Beyond the Echo Chamber:</u></i>
<blockquote>
<i>We have to resist the forces that are pulling us apart, whether they are coming from the left or the right.  Because it is our values
-- our belief that life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness come to us from God, not government -- that ties us together as
Americans.  It is countries where those values are *absent* that tribalism and hatred flourish.  We can never fail to make this case.
</i>
 &mdash; From <i><u>With All Due Respect</u></i>, by Nikki R. Haley, p. 171.

Although it can be rough reading at times, <i><u>With All Due Respect, Defending America With Grit and Grace</u></i> is well worth reading by anyone interested in learning more about today's politics.

And I strongly recommend it to anyone who thinks that all conservatives are alike -- and is open to being proven wrong.
