<i><u>Minority Leader, How to Lead From the Outside and Make Real Change</u></i> is a book by Stacey Abrams published in 2018.

Stacey Abrams wrote it for minorities, women, and others who are outsiders who do not typically occupy positions of power.
She wrote it to help them nurture their ambition, overcome their fear, and learn how to set and achieve their goals.


I read <i><u>Minority Leader</u></i> together with <i><u>Triggered</u></i> by Donald Trump Jr. so that I could learn about, analyze, and draw images of their personality for posting online and possible use in one of my own books.
Both of these books are a little outside my comfort level, but I have learned that pushing myself can yield unforseen yet very positive results.
As it turned out, I enjoyed both books a great deal more than expected, and at this time would recommend both to anyone looking for insight into America's current political climate.


It is no secret Stacey and Donald Trump Jr. have very different backgrounds and belong to two increasingly contentious political parties.
As it turned out, I enjoyed the contrast between the two &mdash; the culture shock of switching from one to the other &mdash; almost as much as I did the books themselves.

Ultimately the most interesting thing I learned from reading these books is both authors agree that ambitious business people and elite politicians all too frequently ignore the "little guy."
They both assert that all leaders should elicit the opinions of average people &mdash; people whom I like to call <q>the salt of the earth,</q> a biblical reference I like to associate with the classic Rolling Stones song of the same name.


Having never belonged to either major political party, I enjoyed reading about how the presumably diametrically opposed Stacey Abrams and Donald Trump Jr. agree on this aspect of leadership.


Stacey is involved in more than just politics, and she addresses her book to anyone who aspires to gaining more power, regardless of whether it is in the public or private sector.
In Chapter 3, entitled <i><u>Hacking and Owning Opportunity,</u></i> Stacey describes how <i>"unusual allies can be nearly as useful"</i> as <i>"strong backers in upper echelons of power"</i> [p. 68].

<blockquote><i>One key approach is to cultivate relationships with those who have information and are typically ignored.  For example, I am always genuinely engaged with support staff wherever I work.  First, because these women and men too often work thankless jobs for demanding bosses and deserve our courtesy.  Second, because they may be the only other minorities in place, and it's nice to see a friendly face that looks like mine.  Third, as I later learned due to points 1 and 2, it's the support staff who hears everything.</i>&nbsp;&mdash; From <i><u>Minority Leader</u></i>, by Stacey Abrams, p. 68.</blockquote>


She goes on to write about Johnnie Booker, <i>"a former head of diversity for a Fortune 500 company"</i> whose secret <i>"had been the secretaries and custodians in the offices where she built her empires."</i> [p. 69].


I am giving <i><u>Minority Leader</u></i> 5 of 5 stars because Stacey's book is full of optimism and ideas that can help anyone succeed.
Her book of positive ideas can even help someone like me, who is not ambitious so much as struggling to learn how to sell my "spiritual portraits."

Where Don Jr.'s book is extremely partisan, and at time when many "woke" people are reacting angrily to the systemic biases in our society, I picked up none of that in Stacey's book.
I am confident that it could help people in either party &mdash; and even the anti-political &mdash; figure out where they want to go, what their motivations are, and how they can get there.

Stacey is refreshingly objective in her determination to help everyone continue making America better and better, and I encourage any of my friends &mdash; even the white male ones &mdash; who are less than 100% happy with where they are to consider reading it.
