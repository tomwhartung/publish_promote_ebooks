<i><u>Minority Leader, How to Lead From the Outside and Make Real Change</u></i> is a book by Stacey Abrams published in 2018.

Stacey Abrams wrote it for minorities, women, and others who are outsiders who do not typically occupy positions of power.
She wrote it to help them nurture their ambition, overcome their fear, and learn how to set and achieve their goals.


I read <i><u>Minority Leader</u></i> together with <i><u>Triggered</u></i> by Donald Trump Jr. so that I could learn about, analyze, and draw images of their personality for posting online and possible use in one of my own books.
Both of these books are a little outside my comfort level, but I have learned that pushing myself can yield unforseen yet very positive results.
As it turned out, I enjoyed both books a great deal more than expected, and at this time would recommend both to anyone looking for insight into America's current political climate.


Stacey and Donald have very different backgrounds and belong to two increasingly contentious political parties.
The most interesting thing I learned from reading these books is that both authors agree that ambitious and elite politicians all too frequently overlook average people &mdash; people whom I like to call <q>the salt of the earth,</q> a biblical reference I like to associate with the classic Rolling Stones song of the same name.


In Chapter 3, entitled <i><u>Hacking and Owning Opportunity,</u></i> Stacey describes how <i>"unusual allies can be nearly as useful"</i> as <i>"strong backers in upper echelons of power"</i> [p. 68].

<blockquote><i>One key approach is to cultivate relationships with those who have information and are typically ignored.  For example, I am always genuinely engaged with support staff wherever I work.  First, because these women and men too often work thankless jobs for demanding bosses and deserve our courtesy.  Second, because they may be the only other minorities in place, and it's nice to see a friendly face that looks like mine.  Third, as I later learned due to points 1 and 2, it's the support staff who hears everything.</i>&nbsp;&mdash; From <i><u>Minority Leader</u></i>, by Stacey Abrams, p. 68.</blockquote>


Having never belonged to either major political party, I enjoyed reading about how the presumably diametrically opposed Don Jr. and Stacey Abrams can at least agree that politicians need to remember whom they are really working for.


I am giving <i><u>Minority Leader</u></i> 5 of 5 stars because [reason].
