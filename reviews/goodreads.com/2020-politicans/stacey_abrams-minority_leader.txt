In January 2020 I read <i><u>Minority Leader, How to Lead From the Outside and Make Real Change</u></i> by Stacey Abrams.  She wrote it for minorities, women, and others who are outsiders who do not typically occupy positions of power,  hoping to help them nurture their ambition, overcome their fear, and learn how to set and achieve their goals.

I read <i><u>Minority Leader</u></i> together with <i><u>Triggered</u></i> by Donald Trump Jr. so that I could learn about, analyze, and draw an image of each of their personalities for <a href="https://groja.com">posting online</a> and possible use in one of my own books.  Both of these books are a little outside my comfort level, but I have learned that pushing myself can yield unforeseen and very positive results.

As it turned out, I enjoyed both books a great deal more than expected, and at this time would recommend both to anyone looking for insight into America's current political climate.

It is no secret Stacey and Donald Trump Jr. have very different backgrounds and belong to two increasingly contentious political parties.  As it turned out, I enjoyed the contrast between the two &mdash; the culture shock of switching from one to the other &mdash; almost as much as I did the books themselves.

One thing both authors agree on is that ambitious business people and elite politicians all too frequently ignore the <i>"little guy."</i>  Both Stacey and Don Jr. assert that all leaders should elicit the opinions of average people &mdash; people whom I like to call <q>the salt of the earth,</q> a biblical reference that brings to mind the classic Rolling Stones song of the same name.

Stacey is involved in more than just politics, and she addresses her book to anyone who aspires to gaining more power, regardless of whether it is in the public or private sector.  In Chapter 3, entitled <i><u>Hacking and Owning Opportunity,</u></i> Stacey describes how <i>"unusual allies can be nearly as useful"</i> as <i>"strong backers in upper echelons of power."</i>

<blockquote><i>One key approach is to cultivate relationships with those who have information and are typically ignored.  For example, I am always genuinely engaged with support staff wherever I work.  First, because these women and men too often work thankless jobs for demanding bosses and deserve our courtesy.  Second, because they may be the only other minorities in place, and it's nice to see a friendly face that looks like mine.  Third, as I later learned due to points 1 and 2, it's the support staff who hears everything.</i>&nbsp;&mdash; From <i><u>Minority Leader</u></i>, by Stacey Abrams, p. 68 [2018].</blockquote>

Stacey goes on to write about Johnnie Booker, <i>"a former head of diversity for a Fortune 500 company"</i> whose secret <i>"had been the secretaries and custodians in the offices where she built her empires."</i>  Johnnie went on to carve <i>"out a space in the organization where she commanded millions of dollars"</i> and even had <i>"an early warning system to let her know when the men in her organization became rankled by her success"</i> [p. 69].

Having never belonged to either major political party, I enjoyed reading about how the presumably diametrically opposed Stacey Abrams and Donald Trump Jr. agree on this aspect of leadership.

I am giving <i><u>Minority Leader</u></i> 5 of 5 stars because Stacey's book is full of optimism and contains ideas that can help anyone succeed.  Her book can even help someone like me, who is not ambitious so much as struggling to learn how to sell my images of the personalities of people like her &mdash; my <a href="https://groja.com"><i>"spiritual portraits."</i></a>

Stacey picked a controversial topic, and where Don Jr.'s book is extremely partisan &mdash; and at time when many <i>"woke"</i> people are reacting angrily to the systemic biases in our society &mdash; I picked up none of either type of negativity in her book.  I am confident that it could help people in either party &mdash; and even the apolitical and anti-political &mdash; figure out where they want to go, what their motivations are, and how they can get there.

Stacey is refreshingly objective in her determination to help everyone continue making America better and better, and I encourage any of my friends &mdash; of course including the white male ones &mdash; who are less than 100% happy with where they are to consider reading it and, Hey Jude, make it better.
