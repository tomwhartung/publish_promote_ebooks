<i><u>Minority Leader, How to Lead From the Outside and Make Real Change</u></i> is a book by Stacey Abrams published in 2018.

Stacey Abrams wrote it for minorities, women, and others who are outsiders who do not typically occupy positions of power.
She wrote it to help them nurture their ambition, overcome their fear, and learn how to set and achieve their goals.


I read <i><u>Minority Leader</u></i> together with <i><u>Triggered</u></i> by Donald Trump Jr. so that I could learn about, analyze, and draw images of their personality for posting online and possible use in one of my own books.
Both of these books are a little outside my comfort level, but I have learned that pushing myself can yield unforseen yet very positive results.
As it turned out, I enjoyed both books a great deal more than expected, and at this time would recommend both to anyone looking for insight into America's current political climate.


Stacey and Donald have very different backgrounds and belong to two increasingly contentious political parties.
The most interesting thing I learned reading these books is that both agree that the more ambitious and elite politicians all too frequently overlook average people &mdash; people whom I like to call <q>the salt of the earth,</q> in reference to the classic Rolling Stones song of the same name.
