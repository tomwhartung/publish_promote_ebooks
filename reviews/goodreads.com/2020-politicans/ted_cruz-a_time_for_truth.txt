<i><u>A Time for Truth, Reigniting the Promise of America</u></i> is an autobiography by Ted Cruz published in 2015.
It covers his whole life, and includes some background information about his father, who came to America from Cuba.


I am giving <i><u>A Time for Truth</u></i> 2 of 5 stars because it was interesting, but a bit condescending, certainly selfrighteous, and ultimately very divisive, partisan and self-aggrandizing.


As the title suggests, honesty &mdash; and the typical politician's lack thereof &mdash; is a key theme throughout the book.
Indeed, after starting off with this theme in the title, he continues with it in the dedication:
<blockquote><i>This book is dedicated to my parents ....<br>It is dedicated to my wife Heidi ....<br>And it is dedicated to truth-tellers and freedom fighters, to the grassroots and the courageous conservatives whose passion and leadership are turning our great nation around.</i><br> &mdash; From <i><u>A Time for Truth</u></i>, by Ted Cruz [2015].</blockquote>

His assault on career politicians in Washington in general, and liberals in particular, continues in the Introduction, entitled <i><u>Mendacity</u></i> &mdash; a fancy word for lies.  <i>"Almost nobody just tells the truth in Washington.  There's always an ulterior motive"</i> [p. xv].

Having branded career politicians &mdash; all of them except for him, apparently &mdash; as liars, Ted claims they are working against the American people.
<blockquote><i>The biggest divide in politics is not between the tea party and the establishment.  It is not even between Republicans and Democrats.  The biggest divide is between career politicians &mdash; in both parties &mdash; and the American people.</i><br> &mdash; From <i><u>A Time for Truth</u></i>, by Ted Cruz, p. xxv.</blockquote>
Ted's divisiveness may be atypical, but it's divisive nonetheless.  In 2015 he was gearing up to run for president and his goal is obvious: to drive a wedge between all of the other candidates and himself.

It is tempting for someone &mdash; like me, for example &mdash; who is cynical about the two main parties to trust and believe Ted.
However, it is now 2020 and 2015 is way in the past.

At this time, in May of 2020, the Washington Post has accused Donald Trump &mdash; hardly one of the political insiders whom Ted is so fond of excoriating &mdash; of making <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/trump-claims-database/" title="Trup claims database at washingtonpost.com" target="_blank">over 18,000 false claims</a> over the course of his time in office.
Brainwashed conservatives may accuse the venerable <i>Washington Post</i> as being fake news, but I counter that where there's smoke there's fire, and 18,000 false claims is a helluva lot of smoke!
