<i><u>A Time for Truth, Reigniting the Promise of America</u></i> is an autobiography by Ted Cruz published in 2015.  It covers his whole life, and includes some background information on his family, including a bit about his father, who came to America from Cuba.


I am giving <i><u>A Time for Truth</u></i> 2 of 5 stars because, although it is interesting, it's also a bit condescending, certainly selfrighteous, and ultimately very divisive, partisan and self-aggrandizing.


As the title suggests, honesty &mdash; and the typical career politician's lack thereof &mdash; is a key theme throughout the book.  Indeed, after starting off with this theme in the title, he continues with it in the dedication:
<blockquote><i>This book is dedicated to my parents ....<br>It is dedicated to my wife Heidi ....<br>And it is dedicated to <u>truth-tellers</u> and freedom fighters, to the grassroots and the courageous conservatives whose passion and leadership are turning our great nation around.</i><br> &mdash; From <i><u>A Time for Truth</u></i>, by Ted Cruz [2015, emphasis aded].</blockquote>

Ted's assault on career politicians in Washington in general and liberal politicians in particular continues in the <i><u>Introduction,</i></u> entitled <i><u>Mendacity</u></i> &mdash; a fancy word for lies.  <i>"Almost nobody just tells the truth in Washington.  There's always an ulterior motive"</i> [p. xv].

Having branded career politicians &mdash; all of them except for him, apparently &mdash; as liars, Ted proceeds to assert all of them are working against the American people.
<blockquote><i>The biggest divide in politics is not between the tea party and the establishment.  It is not even between Republicans and Democrats.  <u>The biggest divide is between career politicians &mdash; in both parties &mdash; and the American people.</u></i><br> &mdash; From <i><u>A Time for Truth</u></i>, by Ted Cruz, p. xxv [emphasis aded].</blockquote>
Ted's particular brand of divisiveness may be atypical, but that doesn't make it any less divisive.  Of course, in 2015 he was running for president, so his goal is obvious: to drive a wedge between American voters and all of the other candidates &mdash; except himself, purportedly the only honest politician in the nation.

It is tempting for someone like me &mdash; who remains an unaffiliated voter due to a shared cynicism about the two main parties &mdash; to trust and believe Ted.  However, it is now 2020 and I, for one, have grown even more cynical about politics over the last five years.

At this time, in May of 2020, the <i>Washington Post</i> has reported that Donald Trump &mdash; who is by the way hardly one of the political insiders whom Ted is so fond of excoriating &mdash; has made <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/trump-claims-database/" title="Trump claims database at washingtonpost.com" target="_blank">over 18,000 false claims</a> during his 1,170 days in office.  Faithful viewers of <i>Fox News</i> and hard-right brainwashed conservatives may accuse the venerable <i>Washington Post</i> as being "fake news," but I must counter that where there's smoke there's fire &mdash; and 18,000 false claims is a helluva lot of smoke!  It's clear to me that Donald will easily hit 20,000 lies by election day in November.

In his book Ted brags about standing up to George Bush.  It's clear that although he is willing to take on a sitting president &mdash; and one from Texas, no less &mdash; he's unable to find the courage to confront Donald Trump and his infamous twitter account.

I enjoyed reading parts of Ted Cruz's autobiography, but at this point in time am forced to acknowledge his premise that political insiders are all prevaricators and only outsiders are honest as complete and total BS.  I can recommend his book only to those who continue to support Donald Trump &mdash; whom Ted had the temerity to call a "<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ted-cruz-what-i-really-think-of-donald-trump/" title="What Ted Cruz really thought about Donald Trump back in 2016" target="_blank">pathological liar</a>" back in 2016 &mdash; despite his continued mendacity.
