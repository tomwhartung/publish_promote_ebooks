<i><u>A Time for Truth, Reigniting the Promise of America</u></i> is an autobiography by Ted Cruz published in 2015.
It covers his whole life, and includes some background information about his father and grandfather.


I am giving <i><u>A Time for Truth</u></i> 2 of 5 stars because it was interesting, but a bit condescnding and selfrighteous, and very partisan and self-aggrandizing.
