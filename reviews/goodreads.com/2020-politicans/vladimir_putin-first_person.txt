<i><u>First Person: An Astonishly Frank Self-Portrait by Russia's President</u></i> &mdash; ostensibly <i>by Vladimir Putin</i> &mdash; contains a series of interviews with Russia's president and several people close to him.  To call Putin the author is a bit of a stretch, because his real role is that of the interviewee.  Published in 2000, it is a different sort of autobiography &mdash; if indeed one could call it that.

It covers Vladimir's whole life, from his childhood through his marriage and time with the KGB, up to when he became the Acting President of Russia.


I am giving <i><u>First Person</u></i> 3 of 5 stars because the book is interesting and informative, but is in a format very different from other autobiographies and biographies.
It makes no effort at being a story, but is instead a series of interviews with Vladimir, his wife, friends, and colleagues.

The unconventional format made it a little difficult to appreciate at first, and it took awhile to get into the book's flow.
