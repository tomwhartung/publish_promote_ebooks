<i><u>First Person: An Astonishly Frank Self-Portrait by Russia's President</u></i> &mdash; ostensibly <i>by Vladimir Putin</i> &mdash; contains a series of interviews with Russia's president and several people close to him.  To call Putin the author is a bit of a stretch, because his real role is that of the interviewee.

Published in 2000, <i><u>First Person</u></i> is a different sort of autobiography &mdash; if indeed one could call it that.
It covers Vladimir's whole life, for the most part chronologically, from his childhood through his marriage and time with the KGB, up to when he became the Acting President of Russia.


I am giving <i><u>First Person</u></i> 3 of 5 stars because the book is interesting and informative, but its format is very different from most autobiographies and biographies, and it took awhile to get into the book's flow.
Rather than talk about Vladimir, it is instead a series of interviews with Vladimir, his wife, friends, and colleagues.
His two children, Masha and Katya &mdash; in their teens at the time &mdash; even make an appearance in a few places.
Interestingly, at one point Katya reveals their <i>"favorite movie right now is <u>The Matrix,</u> but Papa hasn't seen it"</i> [p. 155].


What Putin says about Chechnya is, to me, the most interesting part of this book.
He asserts his actions there were <i>"necessary to preserve the territorial integrity of Russia"</i> [p. 142], and he says the battle is <i>"not against the independence of Chechnya but against the aggressive aspirations that had begun to florish on that territory."</i> [p. 143].

Vladimir insists that <i>"We are not attacking.  We are defending ourselves"</i> [p. 143].
At one point the interviewer asks him about <i>"a version of the story that says the apartment houses were deliberately blown up, in order to justify the beginning of military actions in Chechnya?"</i> [p. 143].  Putin responds incredulously:
<blockquote><i>What?Q  Blowing up our own apartment buildings?  You know, that is really ... utter nonsense!  It's totally insane.<br>No one in the Russian special services would be capable of such a crime against his own people.  The very supposition is amoral.  It's nothing but part of the information war against Russia.</i><br> &mdash; From <i><u>First Person</u></i>, pp. 143-144.
