<i><u>United, Thoughts on Finding Common Ground and Advancing the Common Good</u></i> by Cory Booker is the title of Cory's autobiography, published in 2016.

The book covers Cory's entire life, from his earliest memories growing up - and even at one point traces his ancestry back to the earliest people to settle in America - to the very recent past.  He states it is his "<i>own story and the stories of the people who shaped me</i>" [p. 215].

<i><u>United</u></i> is one of the books about politicians I read in the summer of 2019 while researching a book I have written about incumbents, candidates, and other politicians.  Out of the more than twenty books I read, I thought <i><u>United</u></i> was one of the best, so I am giving it 5 out of 5 stars.

A big reason I liked <i><u>United</u></i> so much is because Cory is humble yet remarkable.  After graduating from schools like Stanford and Yale, Cory decided he would rather help people than conform, follow the mainstream - and no doubt live a rich, comfortable life - so he moved into one of Newark, New Jersey's poorest neighborhoods and started working to help the people who live there.

Cory went on to become first a councilman then the mayor of Newark, and he is now a United States Senator running for President.  Having read his story, I feel confident in saying that although Cory has worked hard and attained a measure of success, he will never forget the lessons he learned working his way up.

When I first heard Cory's name it was in the context of his idea of giving reparations to the descendants of slaves in America.  At the time I found this notion, to be frank, to be a bit "<i>nutso</i>."

This is the great thing about books: having read his story, in his own words, I totally understand where Cory is coming from!  I don't necessarily agree with him, but I understand his motivations, and that makes all the difference.

After reading <i><u>United, Thoughts on Finding Common Ground and Advancing the Common Good,</u></i> I created a profile for Cory and included an image of it in my new ebook <i><u><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XYHQ16R" title="Link to buy the book on amazon" target="_blank">Visualizing Politicians' Personalities, 2019 Incumbents and Candidates</a></i></u>.  I based the abstract image of Cory's personality in the ebook on what I learned from his book, so the ebook of course contains more about Cory's autobiography - in case you are interested.
