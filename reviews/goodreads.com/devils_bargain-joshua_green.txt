After reading Joshua Green's book about [Topic] I incorporated the insight gained to help describe one or more of the spiritual portraits in my ebook <i><u><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Visualizing-Politicians-Personalities-Incumbents-Candidates-ebook/dp/B07XYHQ16R/">Visualizing Politicians' Personalities, 2019 Incumbents and Candidates.</a></u></i>

I based the abstract image of [person]'s personality in the ebook on this book, so it of course contains more about <i><u>Devil's Bargain</u></i> - in case you are interested.
