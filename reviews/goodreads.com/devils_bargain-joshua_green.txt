<i><u>Devil's Bargain - Steve Bannon, Donald Trump, and the Storming of the Presidency</u></i> is a book by Joshua Green published in 2017.  It is about the relationship between Steve Bannon and Donald Trump, includes background information about both of them, and concludes with the election of Donald in 2016.

<i><u>Devil's Bargain</u></i> is one of the nearly twenty books about politicians I read in the summer of 2019 while researching a book about incumbents, candidates, and other politicians.  Michael Wolff mentions it in his book <i><u>Fire and Fury</u>,</i> and that piqued my interest in this book.

According to Michael Wolff, Donald Trump thinks this book by Joshua Green gives Steve Bannon too much credit for his winning of the election.  Wanting to learn more, it was this comment in particular that prompted me to read <i><u>Devil's Bargain</u>.</i>

I am giving <i><u>Devil's Bargain</u></i> 5 of 5 stars because I really enjoyed it.  The background information was very helpful, because most of what I knew about Steve and Donald comes from what I happen to see &mdash; for the most part randomly &mdash; in the media.

I also feel it is fairly objective, treating both Donald and Steve fairly.  That is, having read this and other books on the subject, I wholeheartedly disagree with Donald.

It is obvious to me that it was the <i>combination</i> of the two &mdash; their tiny two-person <i>team</i> &mdash; that enabled Donald to win.  It is also obvious to me that Donald and I think very differently.

One of the most interesting things I learned from Joshua Green's book is the role Robert and Rebekah Mercer played in helping Donald Trump get elected.
<blockquote><i>The Mercer family was not Trump's largest donor, but they were without a doubt the most important in helping Trump to win the presidency.</i>
 &mdash; From <i><u>Devil's Bargain</u></i>, by Joshua Green, p. 131.</blockquote>
The author describes how the Mercers helped to fund the Government Accountability Institute or GAI, which Steve Bannon and others used to discredit Hillary Clinton before Donald was even the nominee.  He also relates how, after the release of the infamous Access Hollywood tape, <i>"Robert and Rebekah Mercer issued a rare public statement reaffirming their support for Trump,"</i> thus letting mainstream Republicans know <i>"that they should tread carefully"</i> [p. 216] or risk losing the family's support.

Reading Joshua Green's book about Donald and Steve motivated me to add a chapter to my ebook <i><u><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Visualizing-Politicians-Personalities-Incumbents-Candidates-ebook/dp/B07XYHQ16R/">Visualizing Politicians' Personalities, 2019 Incumbents and Candidates</a></u>.</i> The Bonus Profile chapter contains the spiritual portrait of Steve Bannon, and examines how he and Donald's differing personalities <i>combined</i> to help win the presidential election in 2016.

The content in the Bonus Profile chapter of my ebook &mdash; available exclusively on amazon.com via the link in the paragraph &mdash; includes more from <i><u>Devil's Bargain</u></i> &mdash; in case you are interested.
