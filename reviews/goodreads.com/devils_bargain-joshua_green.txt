<i><u>Devil's Bargain - Steve Bannon, Donald Trump, and the Storming of the Presidency</u></i> is a book by Joshua Green published in 2017.
It is about the relationship between Steve Bannon and Donald Trump, giving background information about both and covering the election of Donald in 2016.


<i><u>Devil's Bargain</u></i> is one of the nearly twenty books about politicians I read in the summer of 2019 while researching a book about incumbents, candidates, and other politicians.
Michael Wolff piqued my interest in this book when he mentioned it in his book <i><u>Fire and Fury</u>.</i>


I am giving <i><u>Devil's Bargain</u></i> 5 of 5 stars because I really enjoyed it, and feel it is fairly objective, treating both Donald and Steve fairly.
According to Michael Wolff, Donald Trump disagreed, complaining that Joshua Green's book gives Steve Bannon too much credit.
Wanting to learn more, this comment in Wolff's book prompted me to read <i><u>Devil's Bargain</u>.</i>


One of the most interesting things I learned from Joshua Green's book is the role Robert and Rebekah Mercer played in helping Donald Trump get elected.
<blockquote><i>The Mercer family was not Trump's largest donor, but they wre without a doubt the most important in helping Trump to win the presidency.</i>
 &mdash; From <i><u>Devil's Bargain</u></i>, by Joshua Green, p. 131.
</blockquote>
The author describes how the Mercers helped to fund the Government Accountability Institute or GAI, which Steve Bannon and others used to discredit Hillary Clinton before Donald was even the nominee.
He also relates how, after the release of the infamous Access Hollywood tape, <i>"Robert and Rebekah Mercer issued a rare public statement reaffirming their support for Trump,"</i> thus letting mainstream Republicans know <i>"that they should tread carefully"</i> [p. 216] or risk losing the family's support.


Reading Joshua Green's book about Donald and Steve motivated me to add a chapter to my ebook <i><u><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Visualizing-Politicians-Personalities-Incumbents-Candidates-ebook/dp/B07XYHQ16R/">Visualizing Politicians' Personalities, 2019 Incumbents and Candidates</a></u>.</i>
The Bonus Profile chapter contains the spiritual portrait of Steve Bannon and the content includes more from <i><u>Devil's Bargain</u></i> - in case you are interested.
