<i><u>Elizabeth Warren, Her Fight. Her Work. Her Life.</u></i> is a biography of Elizabeth Warren written by Antonia Felix.  Published in 2018, it covers her entire life, starting with some background information about her parents, and continuing up until the very recent past.

<i><u>Elizabeth Warren, Her Fight. Her Work. Her Life.</u></i> is one of the nearly twenty books about politicians I read in the summer of 2019 while researching a book about incumbents, candidates, and other politicians.  I am giving the book 4 of 5 stars because it is thorough and interesting, but not quite as good as some of the other biographies I read for this project.

One of the most enlightening things I learned from this book is how much Elizabeth's mother pressured her to be a wife and mother rather than pursue educational and career goals.  Antonia Felix describes how their ongoing argument reached a climax at one point, "<i>when Liz finally shouted back - <u>Leave me alone!</u> - her mom slapped her hard across the face</i>" [p. 37].

Demonstrating her commitment and determination, Elizabeth worked hard on - and achieved - both goals.  In the 1970s she gave birth to two children, completed an undergraduate degree at the University of Houston, and graduated from law school at Rutgers in Newark, New Jersey.

One of the most remarkable things I learned from the book is that when Elizabeth began studying bankruptcy, she <i>"set out to prove they were all a bunch of cheaters."</i> [p. 83].  The data she found proved her hypothesis was wrong.
<blockquote><i>"I did the research, and the data just took me to a totally different place," she said.  "These were hardworking middle- class families who by and large had lost jobs, gotten sick, had family breakups, and that's what was driving over the edge financially."</i>
 &mdash; From <i><u>Elizabeth Warren, Her Fight. Her Work. Her Life.</u></i>, by Antonia Felix, p. 83.

When she started studying the data on bankruptcies, Elizabeth was a Republican.  After learning the truth about the system - and how it is indeed rigged against the working class - she switched to the Democratic party.

After reading Antonia Felix's book about Elizabeth Warren, I created a profile for her and included their spiritual portrait in my ebook <i><u><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XYHQ16R" title="Link to buy the book on amazon" target="_blank">Visualizing Politicians' Personalities, 2019 Incumbents and Candidates</a>.</u></i> I based the abstract image of Elizabeth's personality in the ebook on this book, so it contains more about <i><u>Elizabeth Warren, Her Fight. Her Work. Her Life.</u></i> - in case you are interested.
