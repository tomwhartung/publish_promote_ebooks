<i><u>Fire and Fury</u></i> and <i><u>Siege</u></i> are books by Michael Wolff published in 2018.
Both books give readers an insider's view of the early days of the presidency of Donald Trump.


<i><u>Fire and Fury</u></i> is one of the nearly twenty books about politicians I read in the summer of 2019 while researching a book about incumbents, candidates, and other politicians.
It would sometimes come up in searches for biographies, and my curiosity about it increased until I finally decided to read it.

I am giving the pair of books an average score 4 of 5 stars because at this time goodreads does not list them individually.
If I could rate them separately, I would give <i><u>Fire and Fury</u></i> 5 of 5 stars and <i><u>Siege</u></i> 3 of 5 stars, because I liked Michael Wolff's first book a lot but found his second book to be mostly just more of the same.


In these books Michael Wolff does not paint a very positive picture of the Trump administration.
From the start he portrays Donald and his supporters as overwhelmed and underskilled.


The author's portrait is certainly not unsympathetic, however.
It did not take long for me to feel somewhat sorry for everyone in Donald Trump's orbit &mdash; especially his close family and mainstream Republicans.


My favorite chapter in the books is Chapter 16 of <i><u>Fire and Fury</u>,</i> entitled <i><u>Comey</u>.</i>
Michael Wolff claims that, when Donald fired the FBI director it was <i>"the most consequential move ever made by a modern president acting entirely on his own"</i> [p. 216].

Amazingly, Trump <i>"had forced [Rod] Rosenstein and [Jeff] Sessions to construct a legal rationale"</i> [p. 220] for firing James Comey, then decided to do it himself.
The author asserts Donald did this because <i>"Cruelty was a Trump attribute."</i> [p. 218].

<blockquote><i>Having enlisted Rosenstein and Sessions in his plot, Trump now exposed their efforts to present a reasonable and aboveboard case as a sham - and, arguably, a plan to obstruct justice</i>
 &mdash; From <i><u>Fire and Fury</u></i>, by Michael Wolff, p. 220.</blockquote>

Reading Michael Wolff's books encouraged me to read <i><u>Devil's Bargain</u></i> by Joshua Green, and ultimately inspired me to add Steve Bannon's spiritual portrait as a Bonus Profile to my ebook <i><u><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Visualizing-Politicians-Personalities-Incumbents-Candidates-ebook/dp/B07XYHQ16R/">Visualizing Politicians' Personalities, 2019 Incumbents and Candidates</a></u>.</i>

The content for Steve and Donald in the Bonus Profile chapter naturally contains more about <i><u>Fire and Fury</u></i> - in case you are interested.
