<i><u>How Trump Won, The Inside Story of a Revolution</u></i> is a book by Joel Pollak and Larry Schweikart published in 2017.
It is about Donald Trump's campaign for president in 2016.


<i><u>How Trump Won</u></i> is one of the nearly twenty books about politicians I read in the summer of 2019 while researching a book about incumbents, candidates, and other politicians.

I am giving <i><u>How Trump Won</u></i> 2 of 5 stars because it is partisan and presents only a conservative point-of-view.

After reading Joel Pollak and Larry Schweikart's book about [Topic] I incorporated the insight gained to help describe one or more of the spiritual portraits in my ebook <i><u><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Visualizing-Politicians-Personalities-Incumbents-Candidates-ebook/dp/B07XYHQ16R/">Visualizing Politicians' Personalities, 2019 Incumbents and Candidates.</a></u></i>

I based the abstract image of [person]'s personality in the ebook on this book, so it of course contains more about <i><u>How Trump Won, The Inside Story of a Revolution</u></i> - in case you are interested.
