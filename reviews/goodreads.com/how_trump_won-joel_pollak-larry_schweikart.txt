<i><u>How Trump Won, The Inside Story of a Revolution</u></i> is a book by Joel Pollak and Larry Schweikart published in 2017.
It is about Donald Trump's campaign for president in 2016.


<i><u>How Trump Won</u></i> is one of the nearly twenty books about politicians I read in the summer of 2019 while researching a book about incumbents, candidates, and other politicians.
I am giving <i><u>How Trump Won</u></i> 2 of 5 stars because it is partisan and presents only a conservative point-of-view.


The most remarkable thing I gained from this book is a sense of how hard Donald Trump worked to get elected.


In this book, the two authors write alternating chapters.
Larry Schweikart provides a historical perspective in the odd-numbered chapters, while Joel Pollak shares his impressions while following Donald Trump across the country on his campaign.


Frequently holding multiple rallies per day - especially towards the end - Joel makes it clear that Donald really worked hard on the campaign trail.


I quote Larry Schweikart in my ebook <i><u><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Visualizing-Politicians-Personalities-Incumbents-Candidates-ebook/dp/B07XYHQ16R/">Visualizing Politicians' Personalities, 2019 Incumbents and Candidates</a></u></i> because he asserts that Barack Obama was elected not on his merits but rather because he is black.
Larry's view is antithetical to my own, and I use it as an example of how we have work to do if we are going to realize the vision Martin Luther King articulated in his "I Have a Dream Speech," given over fifty years ago.


I cannot say I enjoyed <i><u>How Trump Won</u>,</i> but I can say I found it interesting and enlightening.
