<i><u>The Truths We Hold, An American Journey</u></i> is an autobiography written by Senator Kamala Harris, who is a Democrat from California.  It covers her entire life, from her earliest childhood memories up until the book was published 2019, which is also the year in which I am writing this review.

<i><u>The Truths We Hold</u></i> is one of the almost twenty books about politicians I read in the summer of 2019 while researching a book about incumbents, candidates, and other politicians.

I am giving the book 5 of 5 stars because I liked it more than any of the other biographies and autobiographies I read for this project.  Kamala's writing is clear and direct, and she pulls no punches in her praise for the innocent and disdain for the guilty.  There is no mistaking how she thinks and feels, and her idealism and candor are refreshing!

As a city-dweller, I admit this high rating may reflect some bias on my part for stories set in more urban environments.  That is, to be perfectly honest, I find big cities much more interesting than small towns.  My bias gives the stories of city-dwellers like Kamala and Cory Booker an advantage - in my mind - over others such as Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg, who have spent their lives in less urban environments.  Now you know.

One of the more remarkable things I learned from this book is Kamala's description of the settlement she made with major banks as California's Attorney General of the state.  She thought the original settlement offered by the banks to the states was inadequate, so she negotiated with them to get more.  She writes that <i>"instead of the $2 billion to $4 billion that was originally on the table, we secured an $18 billion deal, which ultimately grew to $20 billion in relief to homeowners"</i> [p. 102].

In Chapter 6, entitled <i><u>We Are Better Than This,</u></i> Kamala shows her empathy for less-advantaged people when discussing the American government's policy of separating immigrant children from their parents.
<blockquote><i>There are few things more cruel, more inhumane, more fundamentally evil than ripping a child from her parent's arms.  We should all know this to be true on a gut level.  But if we needed more proof, we could look at a statement released by Coleen Kraft, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, on behalf of the organization, stating that she was appalled by the new policy.  Dr. Kraft wrote about the extraordinary stress and trauma of family separation, which "can cause irreparable harm, disrupting a child's brain architecture and affecting his or her short- and long-term health."</i>
 &mdash; From <i><u>The Truths We Hold</u></i>, by Kamala Harris, p. 171.</blockquote>
Kamala concludes this chapter in her story by saying <i>"Most Americans are appalled and ashamed"</i> and asserting our nation <i>"must make right the wrongs that this administration has committed in our name"</i> [p. 181].

After reading Kamala Harris's book autobiography I created a profile for her and included her spiritual portrait in my ebook <i><u><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XYHQ16R" title="Link to buy the book on amazon" target="_blank">Visualizing Politicians' Personalities, 2019 Incumbents and Candidates</a></u></i>  I based the abstract image of Kamala's personality in the ebook on this book, so it contains a bit more about <i><u>The Truths We Hold, An American Journey</u></i> - in case you are interested.
