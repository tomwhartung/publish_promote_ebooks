<i><u>Off the Sidelines, Raise Your Voice, Change the World</u></i>, is a memoir by Kirsten Gillibrand published in 2014.  The book includes a Foreward by Hillary Rodham Clinton.

<i><u>Off the Sidelines</u></i> covers Kirsten's entire life, and its purpose is to encourage young women to pursue their highest ambitions.  As a reader who is not in her target demographic, it felt a bit strange reading her book, but I wanted to learn about her and there is no substitute for a first-person account.  As a grown man who got dumped long ago at a young, impressionable age for being "<i>too nice</i>," it was frankly fascinating to read her advice "<i>to go for the nice guy, not the hot, flashy, or cool one</i>" [p. 27].  Humph.

Kirsten's is one of the nearly twenty books about politicians I read in the summer of 2019 while researching a book about incumbents, candidates, and other politicians.  I am giving <i><u>Off the Sidelines</u></i> 4 of 5 stars because I found it enjoyable and enlightening, but do not think it is as good as some of the others.

The most remarkable thing about Kirsten is her love of working with and for people.  In Chapter 4, entitled <i><u>The Best Lobbiest I Ever Met Was a Twelve-Year-Old Girl</u></i>, she describes some of the hardship stories she has heard from voters - and her efforts to help them overcome their setbacks and get back on track.

Like other politicians in both parties, Kirsten is in contact with her constituents "<i>in unconventional ways.</i>" Let it be known that she does more than simply maintain a twitter account.  She writes of "<i>working with women's magazines and mommy blogs, communicating through traditionally female means, talking not as a senator would to a voter but the way one mom would talk to another</i>" [p. 99].

After reading Kirsten's book I created a profile for her and included her spiritual portrait in my new ebook <i><u><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XYHQ16R" title="Link to buy the book on amazon" target="_blank">Visualizing Politicians' Personalities, 2019 Incumbents and Candidates</a></u>.</i>  I based the abstract image of Kirsten's personality in the ebook on her memoir, so it of course contains more about <i><u>Off the Sidelines, Raise Your Voice, Change the World</u></i> - in case you are interested.
