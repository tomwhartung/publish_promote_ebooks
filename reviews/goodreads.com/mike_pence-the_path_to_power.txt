<i><u>Pence, The Path to Power</u></i> is a biography of Mike Pence, written by Andrea Neal and published in 2018.  It covers his whole life, from his birth to his first year or so as Vice President.

<i><u>Pence, The Path to Power</u></i> is one of the nearly twenty books about politicians I read in the summer of 2019 while researching a book about incumbents, candidates, and other politicians.

I am giving the book 4 of 5 stars because I found it to be informative and enlightening, but not quite as enjoyable as some of the other biographies I read.  Set in Indiana, it provides a nice cultural counterpoint to Pete Buttigieg's book, which I also read for this project.

One of the most interesting things I learned about Mike Pence from this book is, even though he is devoutly religious, he is also very human.

Near the beginning of her book author Andrea Neal reveals that in high school Mike enjoyed <i>"imitating Darth Vader"</i> and this was only <i>"one of many impressions of famous people he would do to entertain friends"</i> [p. 7].

The revelations continue several pages later when she writes <i>"Pence grew up as a Democrat and cast his first vote for president Jimmy Carter"</i> [pp. 18-19].
<blockquote><i>As Irish Catholics, [Mike's parents] Ed and Nancy Pence identified more with the Democratic Party but over time switched their allegiance to the Republicans.  Pence remembered admiring President John F. Kennedy from a young age.  His maternal grandparents emigrated from the same area of Ireland as the Kennedys, and the Kennedy name appeared down a branch of the Pence family tree.  Pence vividly recalled, then four years old, watching the 1963 funeral of the assassinated president on his family's black-and-white television.</i>

Andrea Neal writes of how Mike spent many of the years before he held elective office as the host of a conservative talk radio show.  She says he called himself <i>"Rush Limbaugh on decaf"</i> [p. 76] and <i>"was deliberate in trying to understand the perspective of callers and guests on the other side"</i> [p. 78].

The author shows how principled Mike's religiousity is when she quotes him as saying <i>"My obligation first as a Christian is to try to respect that person."</i> He expands on this, explaining that "<i>If you can't disagree and maintain some civility, then forget democracy."</i> [p. 78].

After reading Andrea Neal's book about Mike Pence, I created a profile for him and included his spiritual portrait in my ebook <i><u><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Visualizing-Politicians-Personalities-Incumbents-Candidates-ebook/dp/B07XYHQ16R/">Visualizing Politicians' Personalities, 2019 Incumbents and Candidates.</a></u></i> I based the abstract image of Mike's personality in the ebook on this book, so it of course contains more about <i><u>Pence, The Path to Power</u></i> - in case you are interested.
