<i><u>Shortest Way Home, One Mayor's Challenge and a Model for America's Future</u></i> is Pete Buttigieg's autobiography.  It covers his entire life, from his birth in 1982 through when it was published this year, in 2019.

<i><u>Shortest Way Home</u></i> is one of the nearly twenty books about politicians I read in the summer of 2019 while researching a book about incumbents, candidates, and other politicians.

I am giving it 4 of 5 stars because the book is authentic, interesting and relevant to today's political landscape - yet not quite as good as some of the others I read for this project.  Set in Indiana, it provides a nice cultural counterpoint to Andrea Neal's biography of Mike Pence, which I also read for this project.

The most amazing thing I learned from this book is that Pete initially decided to run for mayor of South Bend, Indiana, on a dare - in effect - from Newsweek magazine.

At the beginning of Chapter 6, <i><u>A Fresh Start for South Bend,</u></i> Pete writes that "<i>on January 21, 2011, Newsweek ran a story called 'America's Dying Cities.'</i>"  The article's "<i>authors analyzed demographic data</i>" and decided "<i>South Bend was number eight</i>" in the list of ten cities, most of which were <i>"in the Midwest"</i> [p. 104].

The article prompted Pete to think about running for mayor, and he discussed some of his ideas with a variety of people around town whom he knew and respected.  Ultimately, <i>"about a week after that Newsweek article"</i> came out, Pete decided to take the Newsweek story as <i>"a call to action,"</i> so he <i>"officially announced that I was a candidate for mayor"</i> [p. 115].

The book goes on to discuss Pete's campaign and election, and how he helped turn the city around.  Having heard his mom frequently assert that "<i>What this city suffers from is a lack of imagination</i>" [p. 105], Pete discusses how he put some of his ideas - such as his <i>"1,000 houses in 1,000 days"</i> initiative - into practice with positive results.

After reading Pete Buttigieg's autobiography I created a profile for him and included his spiritual portrait in my ebook <i><u><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XYHQ16R">Visualizing Politicians' Personalities, 2019 Incumbents and Candidates.</a></u></i> I based the abstract image of Pete's personality in the ebook on this book, so it contains more about <i><u>Shortest Way Home, One Mayor's Challenge and a Model for America's Future</u></i> - in case you are interested.
