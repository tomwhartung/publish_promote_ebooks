I am giving <i><u>Just How Stupid Are We?  Facing the <b>Truth</b> About the American Voter,</u></i> by Rick Shenkman 3 of 5 stars beause it is good, but not great.  Published in 2008, the book is simultaneously outdated and prophetic.

In <i><u>Just How Stupid Are We?</u></i> the author examines a taboo subject: the typical American citizen's ignorance of the basics needed for successful self-government.  He discusses how journalists, members of both major parties, and most other observers point fingers at everyone and everything else but ignore the obvious problem: the ignorance of typical American voters.

One of the author's targets is polling.  He notes that while pollsters ask the voters where they stand on an issue, they rarely ask whether the voter is informed on it.

Following is the story of one poll which gave contradictory results - and demonstrates the author's point.
<blockquote><i>Asked in one national poll whether they supported a constitutional amendment allowing only marriage between a man and a woman, a majority said yes.  But three questions later a majority also agreed that 'defining marriage was not an important enough issue to be worth changing the Constitution.'  The New York Times wryly summed up the results: Americans clearly favor amending the Constitution but not changing it.</i>

Leaving little doubt about whether we are indeed dumb, Rick Shenkman looks at the power of myths and television.  He asserts myths have become more important than facts, and claims that television makes us think we are smarter when we are actually less so.
<blockquote><i>Neither Jimmy Carter's enticing smile nor George W. Bush's down-home style, which seemed attractive on television, gave the voter solid clues as to their performance as president.  In this way television misleads people.  It gives them confidence that, because they can see the candidates, they 'know' who they really are.  This is nonsense.</i>
 &mdash; From <i><u>Just How Stupid Are We?</u></i> by Rick Shenkman, p. 106.</blockquote>
Writing during the administration of George W. Bush, the author takes particular exception to some of the public's beliefs in the wake of the terrorist attacks on 9/11.  He also bemoans how voters can be taken in by the misleading spots, such as the attack ads that appear every election season.  <i>"Study after study shows that the spots are one of the voters' chief sources of information - and often the only source."</i> [p. 108].

This may sound depressing, but <i><u>Just How Stupid Are We?</u></i> can provide insight to anyone seeking to understand the forces behind the election of populist candidates such as Donald Trump and Alexandria Occasio-Cortez.

These populist forces are not new, and Rick Shenkman traces them back to the 1830s, writing of how both conservatives and liberals have been exploiting the power of myths, television, and more for a long time.

After reading <i><u>Just How Stupid Are We?  Facing the <b>Truth</b> About the American Voter,</u></i> I am thinking it is unlikely the trend toward using twitter will help anything.  Rick Shenkman's work has confirmed my suspicion that books are a much better source of information!
