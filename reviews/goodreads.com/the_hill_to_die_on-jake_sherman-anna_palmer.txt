<i><u>The Hill to Die On, The Battle for Congress and the Future of America</u></i> by Jake Sherman and Anna Palmer - both senior writers for <i>Politico</i> - was published in 2019.  It is about the relationship between President Donald Trump and members of Congress from both major political parties.

<i><u>The Hill to Die On</u></i> is one of the nearly twenty books about politicians I read in the summer of 2019 while researching a book about incumbents, candidates, and other politicians.  As I looked for biographies of the incumbents and candidates, <i><u>The Hill to Die On</u></i> kept coming up in searches, and I eventually gave in to my curiosity about it.

I am giving the book 4 of 5 stars because I found it to be fairly objective and non-partisan, which gives it a more authentic air than other more subjective, partisan - and much more typical - reports.  The reporters are not necessarily kind to their subjects, but they are not overly cruel either.  I like that!

After setting the scene in the Oval Office and Congress, the reporters start the book in earnest on Election Day Eve 2016.  In its over 400 pages, the book goes on to cover the first 728 days of Donald Trump's administration, with the final chapter entitled <i><u>Shutdown.</u></i>

Jake Sherman and Anna Palmer take subtle jabs at politicians from both sides of the aisle.  For example, near the beginning of Chapter 5, entitled <i><u>The Limits of McConnell's Power,</u></i> they write <i>"McConnell was absolutely, perhaps maniacally, focused on power"</i> [p. 69].

Later the book takes gentle aim at Democratic senators - and presidential candidates - Amy Klobuchar, Cory Booker, and Kamala Harris.  In Chapter 18, entitled <i><u>The Second Seat,</u></i> which is about the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, the authors state <i>"there was a chance they would use the high-profile hearing to play to the cameras, increase the buzz about a potential 2020 bid, and get the pundits opining on whether they came off as presidential"</i> [p. 304].

Although these four senators are not necessarily laser-focused on implementing <i>"the will of the people"</i> - an ultimately inherently subjective idea anyway - the authors make it easy to understand their motivations.

Like any good book, the ending has a climax - which in this case is the shutdown of the American Government in late 2018.
<blockquote>
<i>By the end of the meeting, one thing was clear: The president had sided with [House Representative from North Carolina Mark] Meadows and [House Representative from Ohio Jim] Jordan, two rank-and-file congressmen, over the Speaker of the House [Republican Paul Ryan] and the Senate majority leader [Republican Mitch McConnell].  He wouldn't sign the bill without billions of dollars for his border wall.  It was a stunning coda to a gobsmacking two years.  The government was headed for a shutdown, and no one - including the president, Meadows, and Jordan - had any idea how to get it back open again.</i>

After reading <i><u>The Hill to Die On</u></i> I incorporated some of the insight gained to help describe some of the spiritual portraits in my ebook <i><u><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XYHQ16R">Visualizing Politicians' Personalities, 2019 Incumbents and Candidates.</a></u></i>  If you are looking for more about <i><u>The Hill to Die On,</u></i> you might want to consider checking out my ebook.
