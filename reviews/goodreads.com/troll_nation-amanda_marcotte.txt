<i><u>Troll Nation, How The Right Became Trump-Worshipping Monsters Set On Ratf**king Liberals, America, and Truth Itself,</u></i> is a book by Amanda Marcotte published in [Year].
It is about how some supporters of Donald Trump are extremely rude online.


<i><u>Troll Nation</u></i> is one of the nearly twenty books about politicians I read in the summer of 2019 while researching a book about incumbents, candidates, and other politicians.
I am giving <i><u>Troll Nation</u></i> 2 of 5 stars because it is partisan and presents only a liberal point-of-view.

After reading Amanda Marcotte's book about [Topic] I incorporated the insight gained to help describe one or more of the spiritual portraits in my ebook <i><u><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Visualizing-Politicians-Personalities-Incumbents-Candidates-ebook/dp/B07XYHQ16R/">Visualizing Politicians' Personalities, 2019 Incumbents and Candidates.</a></u></i>

I based the abstract image of [person]'s personality in the ebook on this book, so it of course contains more about <i><u>Troll Nation</u></i> - in case you are interested.
