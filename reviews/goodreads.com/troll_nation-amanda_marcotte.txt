<i><u>Troll Nation, How The Right Became Trump-Worshipping Monsters Set On Ratf**king Liberals, America, and Truth Itself,</u></i> is a book by Amanda Marcotte published in 2018.
It is about the ways some conservatives in general &mdash; and supporters of Donald Trump in particular &mdash; can be extremely rude online.


<i><u>Troll Nation</u></i> is one of the nearly twenty books about politicians I read in the summer of 2019 while researching a book about incumbents, candidates, and other politicians.
I am giving the book 2 of 5 stars because it is well-organized and informative, but also extremely partisan and presents only a liberal point-of-view.

Amanda Marcotte thoroughly analyzes the disturbing behavior of online trolls.
Most of the book consists of entire chapters dedicated to each of the most popular subjects of the rude conservatives who are her enemies: Political Correctness, Women, The Environment, Health Care, Guns, Race, Conspiracy Theorists, and The Media.


Despite this thorough analysis, Amanda Marcotte fails, in my opinion, to adequately explain the source of the hostility.
She claims the trolls do what they do simply to anger liberals &mdash; and I don't buy it.

Wanting to learn more about the presidency of Donald Trump, I recently read <i><u>Devil's Bargain</u></i> by Joshua Green.
I was totally unfamiliar with Nationalist Populism, and while learning about it was able to find some real sources of outrage.

One example is immigration.
Some people are, and have been for awhile, genuinely afraid of immigrants &mdash; and Donald Trump is skilled at riling these people up.
Just because Amanda does not share this fear, or if she believes it is unwarranted or even somehow invalid, does not mean it does not exist.

When people feel threatened, they lash out.
Frankly I feel Amanda wants to lash out at me for this honest review!
Immigration is not in her table of contents, but when people get irrational it's easy to conflate fear of immigrants with racism.

What I am trying to say is, understanding a bit about human nature, and actually digging to find a message within the noise, makes it possible to see the reasons for the trolling could go deeper than to just make liberals angry.

Another thing is, because the book has no references and no index, <i><u>Troll Nation</u></i> is, in effect, just a long rant.
Having read it, I would be leery of having a conversation with her, for fear of saying something politically incorrect and triggering a negative reaction, just for having an opinion different from hers.

I read Amanda Marcotte's book when I was almost done writing my own ebook, <i><u><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Visualizing-Politicians-Personalities-Incumbents-Candidates-ebook/dp/B07XYHQ16R/">Visualizing Politicians' Personalities, 2019 Incumbents and Candidates</a></u>.</i>
By that time it was really too late to include anything from <i><u>Troll Nation</u></i> in the ebook, but I did enjoy reading it.

The bottom line is, I found <i><u>Troll Nation</u></i> to be somewhat enlightening and informative, but only "somewhat."
