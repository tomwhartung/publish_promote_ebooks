<i><u>Troll Nation, How The Right Became Trump-Worshipping Monsters Set On Ratf**king Liberals, America, and Truth Itself,</u></i> is a book by Amanda Marcotte published in [Year].
It is about how some supporters of Donald Trump are extremely rude online.


<i><u>Troll Nation</u></i> is one of the nearly twenty books about politicians I read in the summer of 2019 while researching a book about incumbents, candidates, and other politicians.
I am giving the book 2 of 5 stars because it is partisan and presents only a liberal point-of-view.


I found reading <i><u>Troll Nation</u></i> to be somewhat enlightening and informative, but only "somewhat."
Amanda Marcotte thoroughly analyzes the disturbing behavior of online trolls, but, in my opinion, does not adequately explain it.


In my readings - for example, of <i><u>Devil's Bargain</u></i> by Joshua Green - I was able to find some obstensible sources of outrage.
Some people are, and have been for awhile, genuinely afraid of immigrants.
Just because Amanda does not share this fear, and even if she believes this fear is somehow invalid, does not mean it does not exist.


I read Amanda Marcotte's book when I was almost done writing my ebook <i><u><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Visualizing-Politicians-Personalities-Incumbents-Candidates-ebook/dp/B07XYHQ16R/">Visualizing Politicians' Personalities, 2019 Incumbents and Candidates</a></u>.</i>
By that time it was really too late to include anything from <i><u>Troll Nation</u></i> in the ebook, but I did enjoy reading it - despite the low rating.
