<i><u>Jesus and Personality Theory: Exploring the Five-Factor Model</u></i> is a book by James R. Beck published in 1999.  The author has a PhD, is an ordained minister and a licensed clinical psychologist, and is a Senior Professor of Counseling at the Denver Seminary, where he has taught since 1984.

James Beck wrote the book for Christian counselors.  It uses the five factor model of personality as a basis for looking at the life of Jesus Christ.  The author shows how actually practicing the ideas Jesus taught &mdash; such as spreading joy and experiencing hope, finding the right balance between mercy and justice, and loving and forgiving our enemies &mdash; can actually increase our mental health.

I am giving <i><u>Jesus and Personality Theory</u></i> 4 of 5 stars because I found the book to be enlightening, but it ended rather abruptly.  Also, it has no index, hampering its usefulness as a reference.

Although I thoroughly enjoyed reading <i><u>Jesus and Personality Theory,</u></i> about 80-85% of it is about how Christians can be more like Jesus, and I am not super-religious.  This means only about 15-20% of it is about the five factor model &mdash; which is the main reason I read the book.

Nonetheless, I enjoyed it because it focuses almost exclusively on the ideas Jesus taught his followers &mdash; which are certainly among the more positive aspects of Christianity &mdash; as opposed to the divisiveness and other negative aspects of the church that some non-Christians can tend to focus on.

The five factor model of personality is also known as the <i><u>Big Five</u></i> set of personality traits.  After introducing the model in the first two chapters, the remainder of the book consists of five sections, one for each of the five factors.  It is easiest to remember these using the acronym <b>OCEAN.</b>

The introduction includes a possible rating of Jesus' personality by <i>"two respected New Testament scholars"</i> [p. 33].  Following is a list of the Big Five <b>"OCEAN"</b> traits along with the rating attributed to each for Jesus by the two scholars.

<i><u><b>O</b>penness</u></i> is a measure of how open we are to new ideas, and the scholars estimate Jesus would rate <b>AVERAGE</b> on the scale.<br>
<i><u><b>C</b>onscientiousness</u></i> is a measure of how ordered and driven we are, and the scholars estimate Jesus would rate <b>VERY HIGH</b> on the scale.<br>
<i><u><b>E</b>xtraversion</u></i> is a measure of the strength of our response to positive emotions, and the scholars estimate Jesus would rate <b>AVERAGE</b> on the scale.<br>
<i><u><b>A</b>greeableness</u></i> is a measure of how much empathy we have for others, and the scholars estimate Jesus would rate <b>AVERAGE</b> on the scale.<br>
<i><u><b>N</b>euroticism</u></i> is a measure of the strength of our response to negative emotions, and the scholars estimate Jesus would rate <b>LOW</b> on the scale.<br>

<i><u>Jesus and Personality Theory</u></i> brought the things I appreciate about Christianity to the forefront of my mind.  This in turn reinforces the impression I have that the media is not so much full of <i>"fake news"</i> as it is full of negativity.  Of course, if the outlets focused only on the positive they would no doubt soon go out of business.

Expressing this in terms of Economics and the Big Five personality traits, it's apparent that free markets have taught the media that appealing to their customers' negative emotions &mdash; our Neuroticism &mdash; is much more profitable than trying to appeal to our positive emotions &mdash; our Extraversion.

Thus, the bottom line for me is to try to be mindful of when mainstream and social media are stressing me out, and when this happens to shift gears to reading a book.

Additionally, <i><u>Jesus and Personality Theory</u></i> has convinced me I can be happier if I am more loving, trustworthy, forgiving, and simply a better person than I was before reviewing and learning more about the positive and inspiring lessons waiting to be found in Jesus' teachings.
