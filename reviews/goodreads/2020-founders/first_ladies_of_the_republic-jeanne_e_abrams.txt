Jeanne E. Abrams' 2018 book <i><u>First Ladies of the Republic</u></i> is about America's first three First Ladies &mdash; the wives of the first four presidents &mdash; Martha Washington, Abigail Adams, and Dolley Madison.  Third president Thomas Jefferson's wife Martha Jefferson died years before he was elected, so she is not included in the book.

In those days women could not vote or hold office, but that does not mean these first three First Ladies were passive bystanders.  Reading this book made me appreciate how each of them approached their positions with a combination of humility and pride, and gave me a sense of how each of them brought their own unique talents to help build our country.

As the nation's first First Lady, Martha Washington's hospitality set a standard for her successors.  In Chapter One the author writes that <i>"When Martha was present at social occasions, the ambiance was markedly improved."</i> Furthermore she was <i>"especially sensitive to the needs of former Revolutionary War soldiers"</i> when <i>"they came to visit"</i> [p.73].

In Chapter Three Jeanne tells of how the second First Lady Abigail Adams had an <i>"ever-present taste for her 'dish of politics'"</i> due to a number of factors.  These include Abigail's <i>"own keen intellect and ever-curious mind"</i> and <i>"her father William Smith,"</i> who <i>"had been a prominent Congregationalist minister"</i> as well as <i>"her maternal grandfather, John Quincy, an active politician"</i> [p. 199].

Chapter Four opens describing how Dolley Madison <i>"drew upon elements her predecessors had introduced "</i> yet took it one step further <i>"by astutely expanding her sphere of influence through intentional social interactions."</i> Jeanne goes on to write this was only natural for Dolley, because she had <i>"a charismatic personality almost from birth"</i> [p. 203].

America's first four presidencies saw the creation of two political parties, and a sharp divide quickly developed between them.  George Washington is the only president who did not belong to a party, but by the end of his administration the Federalist and Democratic-Republican parties were well established &mdash; and deeply divided.

Jeanne writes of how the newspapers of the day supported either one party or the other.  In this respect &mdash; with most politicians and observers in just one of two echo chambers, where the truth is often more subjective than objective &mdash; the hostile political climate of the time was much like ours today.

This leads to another thing I got from reading <i><u>First Ladies of the Republic,</u></i> the idea that anyone wanting to see peace between the two political parties should be looking at the candidates' spouses every bit as closely as the candidates.  Near the end of <i><u>First Ladies of the Republic,</u></i> the author offers the following summary.

<blockquote><i>As has been noted, the ability of elite political women such as Martha Washington, Abigail Adams, and Dolley Madison to host and socialize with political players from both sides of the aisle in "quasi-public parlors" made them pivotal actors in the early republic arena.  They were often able to diffuse some of the significant polarizations between opposing parties.</i>

Having read this book, it is obvious to me that the right First Spouse could go a long way towards healing the deep divisions in today's political landscape.

I thoroughly enjoyed reading <i><u>First Ladies of the Republic,</u></i> and am giving it four of five stars.  Having enjoyed this introduction, I will be reading more about these women and some of their contemporaries right away.
