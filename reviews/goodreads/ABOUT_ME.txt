For the About Me box for my profile on goodreads:

A lifelong learner, I have lately been migrating from studying the mostly technical reference and how-to oriented books of my actively-employed youth to reading more history in general and biographies in particular.  I currently enjoy learning about people - both real and fictional - then using a program I have written to draw an image of their personality.  I then use these images as the central content of some websites I have designed, built and host and, most recently, some ebooks I have written.  These images enhance my understanding of both the subjects depicted and society as a whole - the zeitgeist, if you will - and I share them with the hope that they enhance others' understanding as well.
