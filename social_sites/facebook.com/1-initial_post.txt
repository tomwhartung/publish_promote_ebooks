Please buy my new book, Visualizing Politicians' Personalities: 2019 Incumbents and Candidates.  It contains images of the personalities of four incumbents, Donald Trump, Mike Pence, Mitch McConnell, and Nancy Pelosi, and nine candidates, Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders, Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillabrand, Michael Bennet, and Pete Buttigieg.  Plus there's a chapter about My Biases and a Bonus Profile of Steve Bannon.  This content is available exclusively on amazon for a measly $5.95.
Thanks for your support!

This summer I read a bunch of books, then analyzed and visualized a bunch of personalities and then wrote a book about it.  Each image represents an entire book's-worth of information!  What a steal for a measly $5.95!  Yes you can read it on your phone!  What are you waiting for?!?!
