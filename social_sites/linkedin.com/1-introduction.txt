A new ebook, Visualizing Politicians' Personalities: 2019 Incumbents and Candidates, is now available at https://amazon.com/dp/B07XY .

Based on a biography of each person featured, I used a Jungian Archetypes-based questionnaire to analyze the individuals and draw their spiritual portrait.

The ebook contains images of the personalities of four incumbents, Donald Trump, Mike Pence, Mitch McConnell, and Nancy Pelosi, and nine candidates, Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders, Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillabrand, Michael Bennet, and Pete Buttigieg. The ebook also includes a chapter about My Biases and a Bonus Profile of Steve Bannon, describing my take on how his and Donald's complimentary skills worked together to get Donald elected.  All this for just $5.95!  Treat yourself to a fresh, new, neutral view of tired, old, partisan politics today!
