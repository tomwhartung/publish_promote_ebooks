This article briefly describes what is in the book, and includes an excerpt from it explaining how I create these images.

The ebook includes the images of four incumbents, Donald Trump, Mike Pence, Mitch McConnell and Nancy Pelosi, and nine candidates, Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders, Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillabrand, Michael Bennet, and Pete Buttigieg.  Content accompanying each image explains how it expresses the individual's personality.

Also included in the ebook is a chapter entitled My Biases which explains how my personality has affected how I vote.  Following these personal revelations is a chapter entitled Bonus Profile.  It contains an image of Steve Bannon's personality and concludes with my take on how he and Donald combined their disparate innate skills to win the presidential election in 2016.

Following is an excerpt from the ebook, Appendix B: Process

[Begin excerpt]
Process
These are the steps used to create these images:
1. Read at least one book per personality, for each person except for Donald, who appears in the media daily, and myself
2. Answer a Jungian typology questionnaire the way the person being analyzed would
3. Plug the results into the GrojaÂ© program
4. Generate six to ten images for the personality
5. Pick the best image and save it in a .jpg file
6. Use the gimp image processing program to combine explanatory text with the .jpg file and add the enhanced images to the book
7. Use the .jpg  files to create combo images and add those images to the book
8. Add objective, enlightening content as necessary to provide context and ultimately pull all of the images together into a single cohesive whole

Thus, each image in Visualizing Politicians' Personalities: 2019 Incumbents and Candidates distills the content of a biography into a single abstract yet meaningful spiritual portrait and some reinforcing content.
