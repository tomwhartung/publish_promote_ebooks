How I Draw Personalities

This is the process I use to understand, visualize, and draw personalities.

1. Research the Person
2. Answer a Questionnaire
3. Draw the Image
4. Post the Image on the Web
5. Add Relevant Images to an Ebook
6. Post to Social Sites

Subsequent daily posts explain each of these steps in a little more detail.
