How I Visualize Personalities

Step 1 - Research the Person

Videos are available for some famous people, and for fictional and non-fictional people alike, a focused 90-minute movie can in some cases be just enough to create a profile.

Trilogies of movies can allow creating profiles for multiple protagonists in the series, and multple seasons of shows with ensemble casts can provide a universe of characters worthy of portrayal.

The more I know about a person, the easier it is to answer the questionnaire, and now I prefer to read a biography when researching historical figures.

Self-reporting makes this step trivial.
