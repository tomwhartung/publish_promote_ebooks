How I Draw Personalities

Step 2 - Answer a Questionnaire

All Jungian typology questionnaires have similar questions, such as whether you chat up strangers when in line, or do you tend to use your head or your heart to make decisions.

There are no right-or-wrong answers, but many of the questions can be difficult to answer.

Having tried a variety of questionnaires and drawn hundreds of profiles, I have found the questionnaires in David Keirsey's Please Understand Me books to be my favorites.

Answering more questions increases the image's accuracy and uniqueness.
