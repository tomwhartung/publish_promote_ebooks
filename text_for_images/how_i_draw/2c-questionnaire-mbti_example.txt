How I Visualize Personalities

Step 2 - Answer a Questionnaire - Example

The work by Katherine Cook Briggs and her daughter Isabel Briggs Myers on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator or MBTI (r) was one of many inspirations for this project.

The questionnaires I use for these images are based on Carl Jung's personality archetypes, so - like the MBTI - the questionnaire's results can be expressed in four-letter types such as INFJ and ESTP.

In the mid-1990s I took the MBTI, and this is an image of the results:
