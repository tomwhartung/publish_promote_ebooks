How I Draw Personalities

Step 4 - Post to Sites

The galleries at SeeOurMinds.com host the images of hundreds of personalities - both real and fictional.

In 2018 I created ArtsyVisions.com to host some favorite portraits of individuals, pairs, and small groups of people who are related in some way.

Work on these sites is on hold for the time being while I write ebooks.
