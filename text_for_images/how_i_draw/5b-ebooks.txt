How I Draw Personalities

Step 5 - Ebooks

This idea is well-suited to books and ebooks, because those formats allow presenting the images in a logical, step-by-step fashion.

The newest ebook is Visualizing Politicians' Personalities, 2019 Incumbents and Candidates, and there are two editions - one big, one small - of Visualizing Game of Thrones Personalities.

The goal is to get my next ebook, Visualizing Teams on the Wire, available for purchase sometime around the holidays.

All ebooks are available exclusively on Amazon.com, where the URL of my author page is Amazon.com/author/tomwhartung
