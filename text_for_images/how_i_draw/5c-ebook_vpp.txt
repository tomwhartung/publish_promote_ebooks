How I Draw Personalities

Step 5 - Ebooks - Example

In 2019 I started writing ebooks and quickly learned that working with images in them can be difficult.

Ultimately the quality of the images in ebooks is limited by the user's device, and bigger images are much more powerful and expressive than smaller ones, so my eventual goal is to create a traditional print book - ideally in a large format, such as a coffee-table book.

This combo image from Visualizing Politicians' Personalities shows how different Donald Trump and Steve Bannon are beneath the surface:
