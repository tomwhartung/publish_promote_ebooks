How I Draw Personalities

Step 6 - Social Sites

I am just starting to share these images on social networking now - seriously, like right this second!

At first I was going to just post some images and hope people would see the same patterns I see, because they are obvious - at least to me.

But after some consideration it was clear it would best to first post some introductory material such as this how-I-draw-personalities series.

Hopefully sharing this background information has been interesting, informative, and helpful!
