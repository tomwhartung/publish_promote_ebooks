How I Visualize Personalities

Step 1: Research the Person

When first working on this in graduate school in the 1980s, I invited friends over to party and answer the questionnaire so I could draw their images.

Sometimes a few of us would get together and answer the questionnaire the way we thought a someone famous or a character on TV would.

Over the years I have found that a 90-minute movie is the bare minimum needed for a profile, and a trilogy of longer movies allows creating profiles for multiple protagonists.

The more I know about a person, the easier it is to answer the questionnaire.

Self-reporting makes this step trivial.
