How I Visualize Personalities

Step 2 - Answer a Questionnaire

I have tried a variety of questionnaires and drawn hundreds of profiles, and have found the questionnaires in David Keirsey's Please Understand Me books are by far the best.

Depending on the subject and the information available, some questions can be very difficult.

Who's to say whether a historical charactger might rush to answer the phone when it rings, or whether a fictional character might chat while standing in line?

At some point I found a questionnaire suspiciously similar, but not identical, to Keirsey's posted online, and printed out a copy.

Over the years I have made many notes on the hard copy of my favorite questionnaire, and the sometimes vague questions have taken on their own character in my mind.

It may have started out as being similar to David Keirsey's questionnaire, but over the years I have made it my own.

Answering more questions allows the image to be more accurate - and hence better.
