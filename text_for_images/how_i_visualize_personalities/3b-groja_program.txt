How I Visualize Personalities

Step 3 - Draw the Image

The Groja (c) program draws the image by translating the questionnaire results into an image containing a multitude of squares drawn in one of the four primary colors Blue, Green, Red, or Yellow.

GRoJA stands for Graphical Representations of Jungian Archetypes.

In Jungian terms, Blue represents iNtuition, Green represents Thinking, Red represents Feeling, and Yellow represents Sensation.  Images of Extroverts contain a Vertical line and images of Introverts contain a Horizontal line.
