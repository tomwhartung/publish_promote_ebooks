How I Visualize Personalities

Step 3 - Draw the Image

The Groja (c) program draws the image by translating the questionnaire results into an image containing a multitude of squares drawn in one of the four primary colors Blue, Green, Red, or Yellow.

GRoJA stands for Graphical Representations of Jungian Archetypes.

As technology has evolved, I have written several versions of the program over the years.

I had the current version online for several years, but it became obvious that only spammers were interested in finding a vulnerability in the joomla site so they could post their evil links, so I replaced it with a python site.
