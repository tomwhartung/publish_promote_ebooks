How I Visualize Personalities

Step 5 - Ebooks

This idea is well-suited to books and ebooks, because those formats allow presenting the images in a logical, step-by-step fashion.

There are two editions - one big, one small - of Visualizing Game of Thrones Personalities, and the just-released Visualizing Politicians' Personalities, 2019 Incumbents and Candidates.

The goal is to get my next ebook, Visualizing Teams on the Wire, complete sometime around the holidays.

You can find the Game of Thrones and Politicians books on my author page at amazon.com/author/tomwhartung
