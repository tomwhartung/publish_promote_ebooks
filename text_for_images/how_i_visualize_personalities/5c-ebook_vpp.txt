How I Visualize Personalities

Step 5 - Ebooks - Example

Ultimately the quality of the images in ebooks is limited by the user's device, and bigger images are much more powerful and expressive than smaller ones, so eventually creating a printed book would be great.

This combo image from Visualizing Politicians' Personalities shows how different Donald Trump and Steve Bannon are beneath the surface:
